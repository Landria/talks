# Using consent as a lens on relationship structures

## Types of consent

RAINN, the nation's largest anti-sexual violence organization defines **consent** as "an agreement between participants to engage in sexual activity." In the context of sexual relations, this is a very useful definition. However, we relate to people, especially our partners, on many different levels.

The Oxford English Dictionary defines **consent** as "Permission for something to happen or agreement to do something." According to the OED, the word comes from the Latin *consentire*, which is *con-* ‘together’ + *sentire* ‘feel’.

Perhaps that feels insufficient. The same OED defines **informed consent** as "Permission granted in full knowledge of the possible consequences." In many ways this sounds ideal, but like many ideals, it's not a common condition.

In sociology, **agency** is the capacity of individuals to act independently and to make their own free choices. By contrast, structure is outside forces (like religion, gender, ability, culture, etc.) that limit an agent in their decisions. Wikipedia adds that "One's agency is one's independent capability or ability to act on one's will. This ability is affected by the cognitive belief structure which one has formed through one's experiences, and the perceptions held by the society and the individual, of the structures and circumstances of the environment one is in and the position they are born into. Disagreement on the extent of one's agency often causes conflict between parties, e.g. parents and children."

For the purposes of our time together today, I would like to pull these various definitions together into this one:

""**Consent** is agency exercised by and between two or more parties as they relate to each other, the limits of which are informed by cognition, belief, and a cultural narrative."

### Natural consent

**Natural consent** is autonomy, self-agency. Your body is your own. How you use it, where you use it, and with whom you use it is completely up to you. We call this consent “natural” because our autonomy in inalienable. We are not given autonomy; we develop it ourselves as we grow into adult human beings.

### Explicit consent

**Explicit consent** is a clear and timely offer to share ourselves with someone else. Explicit consent is bounded: an offer to share civil conversation does not extend to argument, an offer to share touch does not extend to sex. This is why we seek “enthusiastic consent” especially in new sexual relationships. It is explicit and clear and timely.

### Implicit consent

**Implicit consent** is how we give other people ongoing permission to relate with us in a given way. We might extend permission to a friend to walk into our home without knocking. If we like to be touched, we might give a partner standing permission to touch us. We might offer a frequent lover consent to wake us with sexual intimacy. Implicit consent is how we define our relationships with other people, and agree to have certain expectations placed upon us. However, implicit consent is always revocable — the power to grant and withdraw consent lies with us, not with the person to whom we are granting ongoing permission.

### Delegated consent

**Delegated consent** is when we allow another’s expectations to replace our explicit or implicit consent. If we allow labels like “boyfriend” or “wife” or “lover” to define what is and is not permissible in our relationships, we are delegating our natural consent to other people. An extreme example is “wifely duty”, suggesting that a woman who has chosen to marry has delegated sexual consent to her husband.

### Appropriated consent

**Appropriated consent** is a consent violation, insisting that we are in a position to decide whether or not we are entitled to consent regardless of whether it is given. Entitlement is appropriated consent. Appropriated consent may be claimed based on labels and societal norms, or consent given and later revoked. A person who believes societal norms dictate delegated consent may try to appropriate it from someone who disagrees about what a label means, or whether a label should mean anything in terms of consent.

### Shared consent

**Shared consent** is consent by consensus. The individual retains natural consent, but also delegates reciprocally. Each participant in shared consent can block or allow another participant's natural consent, but they cannot give (or take) consent on behalf of another.

### Modern American monogamy

* In the General Social Survey, a national survey of adults conducted biennially by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, the percentage of Americans who responded that it is “always wrong” for a married person to have sex with someone other than his or her spouse rose to 81 percent in 2008, from 73 percent in 1991.
* During the same period, the percentage of people who responded that premarital sex is “not wrong at all” increased to 51 percent, from 41 percent.
* Although it’s acceptable to live with someone outside of marriage (and a majority of adults do so), having sex with someone else while cohabiting is still called “cheating”: it breaks the unwritten rules and often leads to the end of the relationship.
*  http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2012/01/20/the-gingrich-question-cheating-vs-open-marriage/americans-prefer-serial-monogamy-to-open-relationships

* "Men want wives, and if you need a lot of men on your team, you must offer them something that they want. In monogamous groups, unlike polygynous ones, high status males cannot hoard large numbers of women for themselves. The more equal distribution of women in monogamous groups means that more men can acquire wives, and fewer men have to leave the group to search for wives elsewhere. And the larger the group, the more men there are to fight in battles and to pay taxes for the funding of wars. Socially imposed monogamy, therefore, emerged in the West as a reciprocal arrangement in which elite males allowed lower-ranking males to marry, in exchange for their military service and tax contributions." https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/darwin-eternity/201109/why-we-think-monogamy-is-normal

* "The same goes for marriage: it’s not about us. It was never meant to be. It is about the 'other': our spouse, the children and family we create, and the future that we foster. Through these relationships, marriage does offer happiness; but it’s a long-term, long-suffering joy — one that has to surmount many temporary grievances and frustrations. It’s true that marriage isn’t a 'safe' bet for temporal happiness — but marriage is good, and always will be." http://www.theamericanconservative.com/2014/05/15/in-defense-of-monogamy-and-marriage/

### Historical biblical marriage

* Genesis 2:18 "Then the LORD God said, 'It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper fit for him.'"
* Genesis 2:24 "Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh."
* Leviticus 20:10 "If a man commits adultery with the wife of his neighbor, both the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death."
* Jeremiah 3:8-9 "Yet her treacherous sister Judah did not fear, but she too went and played the whore. Because she took her whoredom lightly, she polluted the land, committing adultery with stone and tree."
* Ezekiel 16:38 "And I will judge you as women who commit adultery and shed blood are judged, and bring upon you the blood of wrath and jealousy."
* Matthew 5:28 "But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart."
* Matthew 5:32 "But I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife, except on the ground of sexual immorality, makes her commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery."
* Matthew 19:6 "What therefore God has joined together let not man separate."
* John 8:3-5 "The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery, and placing her in the midst they said to him, 'Teacher, this woman has been caught in the act of adultery. Now in the Law, Moses commanded us to stone such women. So what do you say?'"
* Mark 10:6-9 "But from the beginning of creation, ‘God made them male and female.’ ‘Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.’ So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate."
* Mark 10:11-12 "And he said to them, 'Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her, and if she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery.'"
* 2 Peter 2:14 "They have eyes full of adultery, insatiable for sin. They entice unsteady souls. They have hearts trained in greed. Accursed children!"
* Revelation 2:22 "Behold, I will throw her onto a sickbed, and those who commit adultery with her I will throw into great tribulation, unless they repent of her works."
* Ephesians 5:22-24 "Wives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church, his body, and is himself its Savior. Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit in everything to their husbands."
* Ephesians 5:25-33 "Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, so that he might present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish. In the same way husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ does the church, because we are members of his body. 'Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.' This mystery is profound, and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church. However, let each one of you love his wife as himself, and let the wife see that she respects her husband."
* Ephesians 5:22-24; Colossians 3:18; see also Genesis 2:18, 20
* 1 Corinthians 7:1-5 "'It is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman.' But because of the temptation to sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband. The husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights, and likewise the wife to her husband. For the wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does. Likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does. Do not deprive one another, except perhaps by agreement for a limited time, that you may devote yourselves to prayer; but then come together again, so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control."
* 1 Peter 3:1-7 "Likewise, wives, be subject to your own husbands, so that even if some do not obey the word, they may be won without a word by the conduct of their wives, when they see your respectful and pure conduct. Do not let your adorning be external — the braiding of hair and the putting on of gold jewelry, or the clothing you wear — but let your adorning be the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which in God's sight is very precious. For this is how the holy women who hoped in God used to adorn themselves, by submitting to their own husbands, as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord. And you are her children, if you do good and do not fear anything that is frightening. Likewise, husbands, live with your wives in an understanding way, showing honor to the woman as the weaker vessel, since they are heirs with you of the grace of life, so that your prayers may not be hindered."

### Modern biblical marriage

From the Family Research Center:

* "Incredible as it may seem, we can no longer assume that people in our culture understand what the proper definition of 'marriage' and the 'family' is."
* "[M]arriage and the family are institutions under siege today, and only a return to the biblical foundation of these God-given institutions will reverse the decline of marriage and the family in our culture today."
* "[T]he Bible makes clear that, at the root, marriage and the family are not human conventions based merely on a temporary consensus and time-honored tradition. Instead, Scripture teaches that family was God's idea and that marriage is a divine, not merely human, institution."
* "[A] covenant is a contract between two parties that is established before God as a witness, a contract whose permanence is ultimately safeguarded by none other than God himself. In this sense, marriage is a covenant: it is entered into by the husband and the wife before God as a witness."
* "God will never sanction a marital bond between two members of the same sex."
* "Scripture is clear that wives are to submit to their husbands and to serve as their 'suitable helpers,' while husbands are to bear the ultimate responsibility for the marriage before God."
* "Jesus treated sexual immorality of a married person, including even a husband's lustful thoughts, with utmost seriousness."
* "[P]remarital sex is also illegitimate, since it violates the exclusive claims of one's future spouse."
* "As a study of biblical history shows, humanity's rebellion against the Creator's purposes led to at least the following six negative consequences: (1) polygamy; (2) divorce; (3) adultery; (4) homosexuality; (5) sterility; and (6) gender role confusion."
* "While it was certainly within God's prerogative and power to make more than one wife for the man, God only made Eve."
* "[N]ot only did polygamous marriage fall short of God's original design, it regularly resulted in disruptive favoritism, jealousy between competing wives, and decline into idolatry.""
* "In the Old Testament, adultery is frequently used as an analogy to depict the spiritual unfaithfulness of God's people Israel."
* "Where God's design for man and woman to be distinct yet complementary partners in procreation and stewardship of God's earth is diluted, people will inexorably be confused about what it means to be masculine or feminine, and the lines between the two sexes made by God will increasingly be blurred."
* "The New Testament teaches that the restoration of God's original design for marriage in Christ is part of God's realignment of all things under Christ's authority and lordship."
* "As the church submits to Christ, so wives should to their husbands in everything."
* "Husbands, in turn, are to love their wives as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her. They are to provide for their wives both physically and spiritually and to cherish them as God's special provision for them."
* "Paul even called celibacy a 'gift from God'. He further suggested that married people's interests were divided while the unmarried could devote themselves wholly to the Lord. What is more, Jesus taught that in the eternal state, there will be no more marriage, but all will be 'like angels in heaven'.

* "Monogamous marriages ensure that both fathers and mothers are certain that a baby born to them is theirs."
* "Monogamous marriages ensure that husband and wife will together care for, nurture, and educate their children until they mature."
* "Monogamous marriages deter both spouses from destructive sexual behavior outside the home."
* "A co-wife, once pushed aside by another, will be sorely tempted to test her neighbor's or servant's bed, unless threatened with grave retribution."

### Polygamy



### Millennials and dating

* One 2012 survey from the University of San Diego found that 58 percent of respondents said there was nothing wrong with sex before marriage, and another study in the Archives of Sexual Behavior found that 45 percent of us of have had casual sex, compared to only 35 percent in the Eighties.
* His study found that 11 percent of 20- to 24-year-olds born from 1980 to 1990 reported being sexually inactive. But for adults born in 1990 from 1996, that percentage jumped to 15 percent. Over the entire population, Dr. Sherman says, that's a dramatic difference – but he also clarifies that that doesn't mean Millennials are practicing abstinence, either. After all, the other 85 percent of these younger Millennials are having sex.
* Goldman Sachs reported that so far in the 2010s, the median age for marriage is 30 – seven years later than in the 1970s. In 2012, a very meager 23 percent of 18- to 31-year-olds were married and living in their own households. For the first time in more than 130 years, adults aged 18 to 34 are more likely to live with their parents than with a partner.

* **Going on dates** doesn't happen. Coffee, a drink, hanging out, yes. Want a nice dinner? Take yourself.
* **Talking** means texting.
* **Hooking up** is an early sexual exchange. It does not imply seriousness, exclusivity, or commitment.
* The **quick jump** is making things official, getting serious. Millennials go from very casual to all formal.
* **Dating apps** are how you meet people.
* **Ghosting** is how you drop people.
* **Gender roles** are more democratic.
* **Long term relationships** don't come from apps, talking, hooking up. They come from long-term friendships, work connections, or friends of friends.
