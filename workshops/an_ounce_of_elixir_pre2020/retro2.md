# Afternoon retrospective

## How do you feel about your code?

"Fucking dope!"

"Pretty clean."

"I don't really know any more, but some people seem pretty stoked about it."

"Incomplete."

"A little more confident in it because we have tests."

"It looks like a manageable code base."

"Our tests are just fine."

"I felt like our tests could have been more 'unit', broken down into smaller chunks. If we change something, we shouldn't have two tests failing."

"The tests look the same as if you were doing object oriented, or Ruby. Just the implementation is very different."

"It depends on the language. I think some of the really low level tests, smallest change possible, is the side effect of a not safe and easily hacked language like Ruby. Elixir is a little more safe, but still not strongly typed. A stricter language and type system wouldn't need a lot of the little tests. I'd feel comfortable writing one overarching test."

"I agree."

"If you have a train of thought, and then someone says do a test, you lose your train of thought. Or anything, doesn't have to be a test."

"I really like pattern matching as a way of incrementally passing new test cases, and then refactoring."

"I liked that we didn't have to read any docs on how to test in Elixir. And that we didn't have to mock anything."

"We weren't stumbling over the language. We didn't spend much time in docs. We didn't spend much time figuring things out. When we needed documentation, it was easy to find the relevant stuff really quickly."

## How do you feel about your team?

"Ducking fope!"

"People interacted with each other. That was good. There wasn't we got stuck and couldn't keep moving."

"There were too many cooks in the kitchen." - Anonymous

"I've done some mob programming before and I think a little smaller would have been good. Better focus, fewer side conversations."

"At certain points, it was clear not everyone could contribute, and you just had to let some people run with it otherwise you're interfering with their thought patterns and it wasn't going to be helpful."

"We had some people who were pretty reluctant to drive."

"People who knew more did a really good job of making us not feel stupid."

"Our team was definitely considerate of one another. We listened to each other and were respectful."

"It seemed really fluid. People would hang out and play games, jump in when they felt like it."

"I think it was kinda frustrating to slow down quite so much, but after I got over that it made sense and we made a lot of progress after that."

"In our group, it was really good when people would explain how they understood things. Not so good when people didn't understand and we were all quiet and we all stared at the screen."

"I had a hard time expressing myself declaratively. I wanted to come in and say 'That function name doesn't really speak to me.' 'I don't like that function name.'"

"I cheated a lot (at declarative vs imperative communication.) Instead of 'Do this.' I said 'I think you should do this.''"

"It was difficult to go with the balance thing, like 'Really, that's what you want to do?'"

"I liked how there wasn't a shy person who wasn't willing to speak up. It was really nice that everyone could contribute."

"I was in a mob before where we got stuck for like two hours and didn't get anywhere. Today there was good momentum."

"I've done mob programming before where we spent the first two hours in configuration and dependency hell, and it wasn't like that today Elixir."

"The mob experience I had before was very different. This one we did a lot of 'yes' to things. The other one was like 'No we're not going to do it that way, no we're not going to do it that way.'"

"I think my favorite thing was that everyone made an effort to make sure we were all on the same page."

## How do you feel about yourself?

"I feel like I learned an immense amount being around people who knew way more. It put me into a mindset on where I should be thinking and how I should be thinking."

"I felt like my purpose wasn't to build something but to help everyone else build something and to be able to go home and do it more."

"I felt like I learned a lot more when I was driving, even when I was just like being a typewriter. I think we should have done shorter terms driving and everyone drive more often."

"I felt sad when I didn't get to drive a second time."

"+1"

"I'm really really excited about Elixir now!!"

"I want a beer."

"I learned that it's really hard for me to break things up too small. I just check out until the group gets up to where my brain is at."

"I wonder if it would be much different with a language we were more experienced with. Especially around the difference between the experienced people and the new developers."

"I felt like we still need to remember when to explain things, otherwise we wouldn't explain things. We don't remember to stop and communicate. Our instinct is to keep going."

"I like how the project we were working on wasn't some contrived project. It was new, and a real project."

"I feel like I learned faster this way [in a mob]."

"I don't think I would have been able to end up with the code we have after the same amount of time on my own."

"Having eight perspectives on one concept was pretty helpful, helped me wrap my brain around it."

"I think it's a good way to learn in general. Maybe not as productive as eight people who have more experience on their own. But if you don't have eight people who know what they're doing, it's going to be way better for them. And even if you're more experienced, it's gonna keep you more focused."

"It was fun."

"My sort of opinion (lol!)"

"The person who's immersed in the subject is going to be more functional than someone who was doing a school."

"It feels a lot more sustainable and engaging. I'm interacting with people the whole time and not just staring at my screen. Not as frustrating."

"I learned better following along like we did last night. Once I have 'this is the pattern', then I can execute the pattern. In the mob, I don't think I could go home and do what we did today. I think I can get more framework in for the amount of time. Once I have the framework I can execute it and try it."

"For me it's pretty much the exact opposite of that. I picked up five or six patterns by saying, 'How do you do this?' and somebody telling me how to do it. I very much apprecaite being able to pick up on the patterns right in the moment in the problem I'm experiencing right now."

"Maybe your brain is more ready because you're a more experienced developer?" "That's entirely possible."

"Just to reiterate, maybe you gotta drive to learn."

"Maybe driving is a good way to get reengaged if you're zoning out."

"Yesterday for me was just ideal, that's how I learn."

"People who are driving maybe don't know how much time is passing."

"A timer might be good."

"I love not driving. One of my favorite things is I can say 'This is what I want to see happen' and then the code magically appears on the screen. I can sit back in a bean bag chair. If the driver types super slow then I'll wait."
