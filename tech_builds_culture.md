# How tech creates culture, and how we're doing it wrong.

Premise 1: Media, including almost all of our software engineering work, is the primary engine for creating the culture in which we live and relate.

Premise 2: A small group of mostly white, mostly male, mostly straight, mostly wealthy individuals create (or direct the creation of) almost all of our media and almost all of our culture.

Premise 3: A culture created by a homogenous group of people will be inherently biased against people who are not in that group.

Conclusion: We can change the world by increasing the diversity in the teams that create our media, and by extension, our culture.
