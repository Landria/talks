This talk covers three topics:

* Functional programming - what it is, why it matters.
* New developers - how to help them prepare to write quality code.
* Mob programming - how we learned to program in groups of 4 - 10 people.

Together, these fit together under the umbrella of building and managing teams of functional programmers, especially when you've already got a team and a legacy code base. Along the way, we'll cover the functional programming workshop "An ounce of Elixir" that I started specifically for women who have not yet worked as a professional developer so that I could learn how to teach functional programming; and a women's internship we ran the last two years, the first one we know of west of NYC. 

While it's not specifically part of this talk, we'll also touch on many reasons why my team of developers is more than half women.
