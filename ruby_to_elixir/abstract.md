Title: Functional Programming from Ruby to Elixir

Presenter: Rob Martin / version2beta

Abstract: We've heard the arguments for functional programming, and maybe we're even convinced, but that doesn't change the fact that we have a body of code in Ruby and people paying us handsomely to work in Ruby because we're good at it. Even if you want to move to functional programming, it's hard to take the leap and become a n00b again. This talk addresses that concern with code. We'll look at how to use some of the lowest hanging fruit from functional programming in our daily work with Ruby. As a bonus, we'll also look at how to do the same thing in Elixir, and see how familiar Elixir feels to a Ruby developer.
