Title: Building teams of functional programmers (that productively includes juniors)

Presenter: Rob Martin / version2beta

Abstract: This is the "Getting started with functional programming" talk for teams, based on two years of research into hiring new functional programmers, training existing team members, training interns and juniors, getting new greenfield projects up and running, migrating existing object-oriented code bases, and even applying functional programming principles to maintaining and refactoring legacy code to decrease complexity and improve correctness. This talk is intended for functional programming leaders at any level, from juniors to CTOs.
