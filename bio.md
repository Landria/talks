Bio: Rob Martin is Vice President Engineering at Big Squid, running both the standard product lines (like Predictive Tool Kit) and Big Squid Labs projects including new product ideas and custom applications for our customers. His background covers embedded (product design and embedded systems), industrial (factory floor automation), programming (25+ years experience), and operations (running hundreds of servers at a time). He has built a team at Big Squid based on creating simple, demonstrably correct code using a development method called functional programming, a topic he teaches and speaks on both in the US and Europe. Rob also focuses on building greater gender diversity in software engineering, which is part of the reason why Big Squid's development team is more than 50% women. Outside of work, he's parent to a son with autism and a daughter who's a professional actor in Hollywood, and occasionally moonlights as a blacksmith.
