# Retrospective

Orlando, Florida - Adult workshop

## How do you feel about your code?

"I feel like my code could be more refined because it's so easy to lose your place."

"Mine was a mess."

"I felt like it was a good start. But, I need more practice."

"I feel our code was pretty great. I think my big contribution was learning, but it was an entirely different way to think about coding than I'm used to and I enjoyed it a great deal."

"I felt it was great, but I feel like I did more learning. I liked the mobbing because it allowed everyone to talk about loud, to think about it, and I feel like I had input."

"I like the mobbing because it gets different ideas, because each person has a different idea of how to solve a problem."

"I understood it more than I thought I would understand, because I thought it would be harder."

"I think we did good, we got past line three."

"I think we were getting closer, right? I hope?"

"We were getting five answersd. We were able to answer how many items we added, the time we added them, the events that occured, the count of items, and we were working on the current state of the cart."

"I kept coming back to an object oriented approach, forgetting about events and started looking at the shopping cart and the objects. I had to force myself to go back to thinking about events."

"Because the scope was open ended, it was hard to decide when what we had was good enough to move on to the next feature, when it was time to refactor, when it was time to move on to the next feature."

"I think the open endedness works well to build off each other's synergy. It helps you to listen to directions other people want to go in. If we had a set path to go down, I think that would have resulted in less participation for everyone."

"I can see how having clearer goals is good. For me, it was really helpful to decide what we wanted to do before we had to do it."

## How do you feel about your mob/team?

"It was super fun!"

"For me at first it was a little intimidating, I wasn't sure where to even start. As we got going, it was fun because everyone was interacting as we got the hang of it together."

"It was kinda difficult for me because I know I could have dominated. Leaving enough air and space for other people, to learn and have ideas - I was always kind of holding back, but knowing when I had something to say that could be helpful, so everyone had the opportunity to contribute."

"Like he was saying, he was holding it in. The guys that were with us, they were like going a hundred miles an hour. We were just trying to follow. We really didn't have time to think. We were like trying to keep up as they were typing. Afterward, it was just a lot easier. Before they were just providing the answers. We weren't thinking about the answers."

"It's true."

"They really did mean well, we really did appreciate their expertise and input. They were more experienced but it was just too fast for us."

"I guess from hearing everyone's comments I'm noticing a demographic pattern in how people experienced the mob session. It seems that the composition of our group was mainly men who had some years of experience coming into the workshop and women who had less experience. People who had more experience had a more difficult time with mob programming than the people who had less experience. Also we had two separate experiences where the people who had more experience left people behind in one group, and people who were more careful in the other group."

"It was a funny shift because he listened better when he wasn't driving."

"That's what I liked about mob programming because as the driver your role is to type, not to code, and I liked that."

"I feel like once the guys left, we were all getting along."

"I don't like to exclude men because we have to get to a place where we can all communicate."

"Its hard for a woman to speak up."

"I think in our group you guys were great."

## How do you feel about yourself?

"I have a long way to go."

"It's not like I'm unmotivated. I'm more motivated to keep learning this."

"I maybe came with different expectations. I feel like I can go home and extend the code we worked on today."

"It makes me want to learn more about programming. It exercises parts of my brain I didn't know existed."

"I can do it."

"I feel like I want to learn to create more learning environments like the one we had today."

"I tink what made the biggest difference is doing the group work. When you actually have hands on, that's when you see you can really do this."

"I feel like I learned a great deal, but what we did as a group would have taken me individually ten as long. As a group, we were able to accomplish so much more."

"I guess it works because of the logic we use. We all try to use the same logic even though the approach is different. It's all towards the same goal."

"I know more now than I did walking in this morning. I was surprised at how much my limited skills in programming translated over. As we were going through, I knew what we needed to do. I don't necessarily have the skill to do that on my own. The stuff between point A and point Z I'm still fuzzy on."

"I feel like some of the code katas and stuff I was doing with .map and .reduce in javascript really helped me."

"I feel like I need to go back to programming fundamentals, that it's not something my brain comes to naturally."

"There's so much great functional javascript stuff going on right now. These skills are going to translate so well right now."

"I was surprised at how much I looked back on how much I know about javascript and how it applies to Elixir."
