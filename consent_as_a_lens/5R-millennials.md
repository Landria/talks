# Millennials

From Rolling Stone (http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/inside-the-awkward-world-of-millennial-dating-w449041):

* One 2012 survey from the University of San Diego found that 58 percent of respondents said there was nothing wrong with sex before marriage, and another study in the Archives of Sexual Behavior found that 45 percent of us of have had casual sex, compared to only 35 percent in the Eighties.



* His study found that 11 percent of 20- to 24-year-olds born from 1980 to 1990 reported being sexually inactive. But for adults born in 1990 from 1996, that percentage jumped to 15 percent. Over the entire population, Dr. Sherman says, that's a dramatic difference – but he also clarifies that that doesn't mean Millennials are practicing abstinence, either. After all, the other 85 percent of these younger Millennials are having sex.



* Goldman Sachs reported that so far in the 2010s, the median age for marriage is 30 – seven years later than in the 1970s. In 2012, a very meager 23 percent of 18- to 31-year-olds were married and living in their own households. For the first time in more than 130 years, adults aged 18 to 34 are more likely to live with their parents than with a partner.


Dating habits of millennials

* **Going on dates** doesn't happen. Coffee, a drink, hanging out, yes. Want a nice dinner? Take yourself.

* **Talking** means texting.

* **Hooking up** is an early sexual exchange. It does not imply seriousness, exclusivity, or commitment.

* The **quick jump** is making things official, getting serious. Millennials go from very casual to all formal.

* **Dating apps** are how you meet people.

* **Ghosting** is how you drop people.

* **Gender roles** are more democratic.

* **Long term relationships** don't come from apps, talking, hooking up. They come from long-term friendships, work connections, or friends of friends.
