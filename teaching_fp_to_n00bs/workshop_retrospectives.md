# Retrospectives from Ounce of Elixir workshops

## What worked well?

"Typing notes in english about what we want to accomplish. Pseudocode."

"Documentation"

"The TV worked well."

"When I walked in, I didn't realize it wasn't Ruby."

"Mob programming is working well. There's a good constant dialogue that feels productive."

"Pushed to GitHub so we can all see it on our own computers and drive on multiple computers. That's working well."

"Having someone who at least understands Elixir a little bit."

"I should make some dummy data for use down the road. That lead to a conversation about books and now I have a book coming to me in a couple days."

## What didn't work well?

"We had a hard time deciding on project structure."

"I saw some people weren't as involved as others."

"I had a harder time following along. They were doing stuff but I wasn't involved because I didn't understand what they were doing."

"I was struggling with the syntax and things of this language so I felt like I couldn't follow along. It's like they were speaking chinese or something."

"Just because I didn't speak up often, doesn't mean I wasn't engaged. I was just trying to keep up but not in a bad way."

"I'm new to mobbing. The group feels big to me."

## What would you like to try differently?

"Alwas keep the code on the big screen"

"I wonder if it's okay for one or two developers to follow their own path, and try things out."

"It'd be cool to try with only one computer working and everyone working off that one."

"Because none of us know the language most of us were on doc pages." "Two computers with two big monitors? One with code and one with docs and help?"

"n00bs only! n00bs rulez!"

## What has you baffled?

"In a group that big, there are a lot of different ideas. It's hard to tell how long and how far we should go down each path."

"Seeing other people type, versus typing on your own all the way through, means it helped you to understand what your options are for the code. In a mob, most of the time I'm not getting that benefit."

## How do you feel about your code?

"Fucking dope!"

"Pretty clean."

"I don't really know any more, but some people seem pretty stoked about it."

"Incomplete."

"A little more confident in it because we have tests."

"It looks like a manageable code base."

"Our tests are just fine."

"I felt like our tests could have been more 'unit', broken down into smaller chunks. If we change something, we shouldn't have two tests failing."

"The tests look the same as if you were doing object oriented, or Ruby. Just the implementation is very different."

"It depends on the language. I think some of the really low level tests, smallest change possible, is the side effect of a not safe and easily hacked language like Ruby. Elixir is a little more safe, but still not strongly typed. A stricter language and type system wouldn't need a lot of the little tests. I'd feel comfortable writing one overarching test."

"I agree."

"If you have a train of thought, and then someone says do a test, you lose your train of thought. Or anything, doesn't have to be a test."

"I really like pattern matching as a way of incrementally passing new test cases, and then refactoring."

"I liked that we didn't have to read any docs on how to test in Elixir. And that we didn't have to mock anything."

"We weren't stumbling over the language. We didn't spend much time in docs. We didn't spend much time figuring things out. When we needed documentation, it was easy to find the relevant stuff really quickly."

"It's kinda less hacky. You have other people looking at you code, so you become more aware and think things through."

"It's a group effort, everybody is influence the code."

"I don't think it'd be possible to do any of that on my own. Although it was cool to do, I'm not sure on my own I'd be able to do all that much."

"I think it was good to watch your code evolve as well. You start doing it one way and then it goes down another way."

"Everyone had something, an idea at least of how you can work it out. It's almost like you have to have a certain skill level to even know what to google for."

"I can type in the shell, and I can repeat some of the things we did in live coding, and I can get out of the shell again."

"I'd feel comfortable experimenting in the shell and expanding on what I learned today. I learned more today than I could have on my own in the same amount of time."

"I could write a test, at least a simple one."

"We got to the point of being able to count the number of items in the cart, taking into consider items that were removed."

"Individually, I'm disappointed in my code and don't feel like I contributed." "Not true, definitely not true."

"I think it's amazing that even though everyone there knows very little we could still figure something out."

"Make a shopping cart! OMG!" "When we started I thought we weren't going to get anywhere. We got a lot farther than I expected. I think we were all surprised every time something works."

"I think we've gotten better at debugging and looking at the error messages and working it out."

Six people thought they might be able to extend the mob code to show the current state of the cart, at least if they could phone a friend.

"Even though I don't use Elixir in my daily life, I feel like I learned skills I can use in other languages I use."

"I'm not likely to use Elixir but I wanted to learn programming generally and it was good."

"It was definitely a very good experience, and I learned quite a lot. I'm very glad you welcomed me here to be part of the group." "I'm happy to be an honorary lady too. It's a good insight into how functional programming works. It's given me a lot of good concepts I can drag into what I do."

"I did a coding workshop earlier this week, and after this session I think it made everything a lot less daunting. Collaborating this way is brilliant for new programmers."

## How do you feel about your team?

"Ducking fope!"

"People interacted with each other. That was good. There wasn't we got stuck and couldn't keep moving."

"There were too many cooks in the kitchen." - Anonymous

"I've done some mob programming before and I think a little smaller would have been good. Better focus, fewer side conversations."

"At certain points, it was clear not everyone could contribute, and you just had to let some people run with it otherwise you're interfering with their thought patterns and it wasn't going to be helpful."

"We had some people who were pretty reluctant to drive."

"People who knew more did a really good job of making us not feel stupid."

"Our team was definitely considerate of one another. We listened to each other and were respectful."

"It seemed really fluid. People would hang out and play games, jump in when they felt like it."

"I think it was kinda frustrating to slow down quite so much, but after I got over that it made sense and we made a lot of progress after that."

"In our group, it was really good when people would explain how they understood things. Not so good when people didn't understand and we were all quiet and we all stared at the screen."

"I had a hard time expressing myself declaratively. I wanted to come in and say 'That function name doesn't really speak to me.' 'I don't like that function name.'"

"I cheated a lot (at declarative vs imperative communication.) Instead of 'Do this.' I said 'I think you should do this.''"

"It was difficult to go with the balance thing, like 'Really, that's what you want to do?'"

"I liked how there wasn't a shy person who wasn't willing to speak up. It was really nice that everyone could contribute."

"I was in a mob before where we got stuck for like two hours and didn't get anywhere. Today there was good momentum."

"I've done mob programming before where we spent the first two hours in configuration and dependency hell, and it wasn't like that today Elixir."

"The mob experience I had before was very different. This one we did a lot of 'yes' to things. The other one was like 'No we're not going to do it that way, no we're not going to do it that way.'"

"I think my favorite thing was that everyone made an effort to make sure we were all on the same page."

"The mob was far less stressful than I thought it would be."

"It was far less intimidating than I thought it would be. You had everyone working, everyone looking for something to work so you never really gave up. The environment was motivating."

"I think it was quite exciting as well to be collaborating to something that looked quite complicated, and that everyone contributed part of their knowledge, it was really quite amazing."

"The keyboard just passed around for every member, that was good."

"I think passing the keyboard around separated the tasks as well, so everyone got to work on different aspects of the problem."

"I was amazed that Alicia told me at the end 'I've never programmed before' and I didn't believe her. Everyone's just contributing, and even if you don't know the techical aspects of an idea you can still kinda get there."

"It was quite nice that roles weren't assigned, that we just sat down and started talking and swapped roles constantly. It kept it interesting."

"It was also more productive as well. At one time we weren't working on just one problem. People were searching for other things as well at the same time."

"It felt more productive than on your own. Because you're sort of constantly going, it felt like you got more done."

"We did a whole-mob break and that was fun because we chatted."

"Plus I think you don't get bored quite so easily. Normally when I work alone I get bored quite easily, but in the mob you keep more focused."

"The fact that you have one keyboard and one screen, it helps in the collaboration process."

## How do you feel about yourself?

"I feel like I learned an immense amount being around people who knew way more. It put me into a mindset on where I should be thinking and how I should be thinking."

"I felt like my purpose wasn't to build something but to help everyone else build something and to be able to go home and do it more."

"I felt like I learned a lot more when I was driving, even when I was just like being a typewriter. I think we should have done shorter terms driving and everyone drive more often."

"I felt sad when I didn't get to drive a second time."

"+1"

"I'm really really excited about Elixir now!!"

"I want a beer."

"I learned that it's really hard for me to break things up too small. I just check out until the group gets up to where my brain is at."

"I wonder if it would be much different with a language we were more experienced with. Especially around the difference between the experienced people and the new developers."

"I felt like we still need to remember when to explain things, otherwise we wouldn't explain things. We don't remember to stop and communicate. Our instinct is to keep going."

"I like how the project we were working on wasn't some contrived project. It was new, and a real project."

"I feel like I learned faster this way [in a mob]."

"I don't think I would have been able to end up with the code we have after the same amount of time on my own."

"Having eight perspectives on one concept was pretty helpful, helped me wrap my brain around it."

"I think it's a good way to learn in general. Maybe not as productive as eight people who have more experience on their own. But if you don't have eight people who know what they're doing, it's going to be way better for them. And even if you're more experienced, it's gonna keep you more focused."

"It was fun."

"My sort of opinion (lol!)"

"The person who's immersed in the subject is going to be more functional than someone who was doing a school."

"It feels a lot more sustainable and engaging. I'm interacting with people the whole time and not just staring at my screen. Not as frustrating."

"I learned better following along like we did last night. Once I have 'this is the pattern', then I can execute the pattern. In the mob, I don't think I could go home and do what we did today. I think I can get more framework in for the amount of time. Once I have the framework I can execute it and try it."

"For me it's pretty much the exact opposite of that. I picked up five or six patterns by saying, 'How do you do this?' and somebody telling me how to do it. I very much apprecaite being able to pick up on the patterns right in the moment in the problem I'm experiencing right now."

"Maybe your brain is more ready because you're a more experienced developer?" "That's entirely possible."

"Just to reiterate, maybe you gotta drive to learn."

"Maybe driving is a good way to get reengaged if you're zoning out."

"Yesterday for me was just ideal, that's how I learn."

"People who are driving maybe don't know how much time is passing."

"A timer might be good."

"I love not driving. One of my favorite things is I can say 'This is what I want to see happen' and then the code magically appears on the screen. I can sit back in a bean bag chair. If the driver types super slow then I'll wait."

"Cool."

"I finally learned something new after a few years of only Ruby and Javascript."

"I definitely want to learn more. I think it's more exciting than something like Java for instance."

"I feel confident that I can learn to program. It's not completely far away, out of my reach. It's something I've wanted to learn for a long time."

"I understand functional programming much better now."

"I just wanted to get out of the house." "It's much better than spending Saturday watching TV."

"Free food!" "And really good free food!"

"I'm a newby and I always think 'I don't understand much, I don't know much.' But I kept up with it. And it's more comforting to me, that I want to keep going on this."

"It's great to learn things and do some examples, but seeing how you can use it is really good."

"It'd be really nice to know what level we're at. After doing this weekend, how far along are we to being able to do real programs that do things?"

"I still feel undecided about whether mob programming can work for me."

"I just feel excited."

"I feel very energized. I don't feel half asleep like I do on most Saturdays. I feel like I want to go home and do programming."
