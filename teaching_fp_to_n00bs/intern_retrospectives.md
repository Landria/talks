# Retrospectives from internship

## 9/15/15

What went well, what you want to do more of?
* Figuring out bugs together
* We accomplished something - we actually wrote some code and solved some problems
* We were focused on the same thing together
* We found more different resources to help problem solve
* It's easier to feel comfortable with your own knowledge level

What didn't go well, what would you like to do differently?
* Turn-taking - more frequent rotations
* Not knowing how to rotate sharing the computer, versus pushing and pulling
* Sometimes we don't want to touch someone else's computer
* What if we get really good at pushing and pulling; but if it's not on github, then we'd have to share
* We could develop the same setups on every machine so we all become comfortable with the same shortcuts and such
* Larger font; speak louder; line of sight to each person
            
What still has you baffled?
* The flow between different Metalsmith files
* Knowing what to google
* Google the error code

## 9/17/15

What went well?
* Figuring out problems pretty easily
* We got the Metalsmith tutorial done
* We all took turns more
* We noticed the difference between driving and navigating
* Pushing and pulling from github
* One person reading the tutorial out loud when that was appropriate
* Useful to keep going through the retrospective to get at deeper issues

What didn't go well?
* Still some github issues - stashing
* Because we each have computers in use, sometimes changes get made to someone's code who is not the driver, and then their code doesn't match what is pulled.
* Sometimes we made a duplicate folder
* Sometimes we stashed
* Driver feels a certain pressure to know what's going on even if that may not be the correct role for the driver
* Sometimes it's still hard to believe that your questions are valuable (fresh eyes are an independent value)

What should we try different next time?
* No one else types on the file
* No one else has a computer open
* One computer for the driver and one for research
* Essentially, don't work individually
* Trade more frequently
* Set an alarm for turn-taking 
* Maybe 20 minutes each
* Some concern about how much time it takes to push and pull
* Review what we are to do the next day so we can review on our own before doing it tomorrow
* Try designating one navigator so the driver doesn't get confused 
* Discuss what the driver is about to do, the basic idea of what the code we're about to add is going to do, why we're adding it

What still has you baffled?
* How to apply the ideas of mobbing to generating new code
* How to apply the information from the tutorials to new code

## 9/18/15

What went well?
* Using a timer worked really well, when we remembered to use it
* Metalsmith app works! 
* Finished the Robin Thrift tutorial
* Started about-me page with React, router & sidebar
* It's valuable to see that I'm not the only one who gets stuck on a problem
* It is valuable to see how others solve problems

What didn't go so well?
* Metalsmith-serve not working
* Amanda steered us off course
* Metalsmith-serve (and all Metalsmith stuff) docs sparse, difficult to use

What should we try different next time?
* Don't listen to Amanda :)
* Listen to Julia more, sometimes
* 15-20 minute coding times
* Remember to start the timer

## 9/21/15

### AM

What went well?
* Defining roles (navigator, facilitator, driver, bug squasher)
* Tutorial was short & simple, easy to follow, no issues
* Typing things out allowed navigator to describe the code, which was helpful

What didn't go so well?
* Vijaya's laptop
* Megha didn't get to drive b/c tutorial was short

What should we try differently next time?
* Estimate time tutorial will take to help decide driving time
* Type each line (instead of copy/ paste)
* 15 minute drive time

### PM

What went well?
* Julia's explanation made working with the projects link much easier.
* We got the Projects link added.
* Turn-taking with the cards was good, especially separating the task of researching errors.
* We remembered the timer.
* We're getting really good at trouble-shooting.
* Watching how other people do things is very helpful.

What didn't go well?
* Github pulling wasn't as smooth as we'd like.
* Didn't make as much outward progress as we could have liked. More time resolving issues, which doesn't have visible results.
* Still too much time in transition, so 15 minute turns seemed a bit slower.

What to do better next time?
* Practice merging Github conflicts.
* Don't count resolving Github conflicts in turn timer until we get pretty good at that. 

What still has you baffled?
* npm start problem caused by having the port still in use; use activity monitor to kill the process and try npm start again.

## 9/22/15

What went well?
* Progress on getting the rabbitmq up and running
* Working together to problem solve
* Adding the json file and json loader to about-me-using-react

What didn't go well?
* There was some issue with node after we installed homebrew
* Fire drills kept interrupting us, taking an hour plus transition time
* We didn't get to the HR thing...the ADP payroll training
* We didn't have that much mobbing time because of interruptions
* Homebrew issues took a lot of time

What could be done better next time?
* Get the rabbitmq up and running all the way
* Review the payroll training
* Devise a more coordinated way to work on installation issues
* Start tracking, using, say google docs, issues and troubleshooting links to sites that were useful to              the troubleshooting process.
