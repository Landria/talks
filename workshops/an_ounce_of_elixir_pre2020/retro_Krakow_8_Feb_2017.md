# Retrospective, Krakow, 8 February 2017

## How do you feel about your code?

"I'm so excited that it works!"

"Spectacular."

"I've learned a lot."

"It's great to adventure, that we can continue."

"Found my +1 here. Would recommend."

"I'm not sure if I fully understand the difference between OO and FP
programming. I only understand some parts, but I don't know when you should pick
OO and functional."

"The tutor is very patient."

"It's nice that we had a story with playing Scrabble and then tried to solve a
real problem. It's not a abstract programming task but something real."

"The code is shorter and easier to read than it would be if we used imperative
languages."

"This course got me invited into a lady's night. Well, a ladies programming
event."

"It's not enough to understand everything, but it's a good start."

"Unfortunately, it won't help me beat my family at Scrabble because we play in
Polish. Will it work with Polish letters? Oh, I take it back."

"Maybe it would be cool if you gave a task to finish at home, so we don't have
infinite problems to solve instead."

## How do you feel about the group?

"Everyone was helpful."

"Other people can help catch my errors."

"I even got job searching advice."

"Because we are a small group, I think it's good that everyone help everyone.
But if we were a bigger group, I think pairs are a good idea."

"We all seem to have started at roughly the same level. We had someone who
studies CS but he's second year. It's hard to conduct a workshop when you have a
very varied skill level."

"Because we had a small group, there was good opportunity to rest and interact
with other people. It's a good idea to make the workshops small."

## How do you feel about yourself?

"I feel like I've gotten an insight into FP that I had no idea about
beforehand."

"I'm satisfied about trying something new."

"Proud that I understood almost everything."

"Mindblown. I'm not tired at all. It was a new experience for me, totally new. I understood almost everything. There is time to understand everything else in the next two years."
