# Functional programming from Ruby to Elixir

Maybe you're decided to learn functional programming, but that doesn't change the fact that we have a body of code in Ruby and people paying us handsomely to work on it - and taking the leap from OO to FP n00b is hard! This talk answers these concerns with code. We'll look at how to use the lowest hanging fruit from functional programming in our daily work with Ruby. As a bonus, we'll also look at how to do the same thing in Elixir, and see how familiar Elixir feels to a Ruby developer.
