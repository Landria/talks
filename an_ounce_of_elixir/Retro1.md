# Morning retrospective

## What worked well?

"Typing notes in english about what we want to accomplish. Pseudocode."

"Documentation"

"The TV worked well."

"When I walked in, I didn't realize it wasn't Ruby."

"Mob programming is working well. There's a good constant dialogue that feels productive."

"Pushed to GitHub so we can all see it on our own computers and drive on multiple computers. That's working well."

"Having someone who at least understands Elixir a little bit."

"I should make some dummy data for use down the road. That lead to a conversation about books and now I have a book coming to me in a couple days."

## What didn't work well?

"We had a hard time deciding on project structure."

"I saw some people weren't as involved as others."

"I had a harder time following along. They were doing stuff but I wasn't involved because I didn't understand what they were doing."

"I was struggling with the syntax and things of this language so I felt like I couldn't follow along. It's like they were speaking chinese or something."

"Just because I didn't speak up often, doesn't mean I wasn't engaged. I was just trying to keep up but not in a bad way."

"I'm new to mobbing. The group feels big to me."

## What would you like to try differently?

"Alwas keep the code on the big screen"

"I wonder if it's okay for one or two developers to follow their own path, and try things out."

"It'd be cool to try with only one computer working and everyone working off that one."

"Because none of us know the language most of us were on doc pages." "Two computers with two big monitors? One with code and one with docs and help?"

"n00bs only! n00bs rulez!"

## What has you baffled?

"In a group that big, there are a lot of different ideas. It's hard to tell how long and how far we should go down each path."

"Seeing other people type, versus typing on your own all the way through, means it helped you to understand what your options are for the code. In a mob, most of the time I'm not getting that benefit."
