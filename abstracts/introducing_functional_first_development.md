Title:

Introducing functional first development

Description:

Functional programming offers significant benefits to many development teams, including reduced complexity, smaller code bases, less technical debt, easier testing, and more scalability. But adopting a functional programming language is costly - the learning curve for experienced object oriented programmers is steep, it's harder to find experienced developers, and it's a rewrite, not a refactor.

Functional first development is a way to introduce functional programming concepts - and benefits - without changing languages.

This talk starts with a brief case for functional programming, then introduces a way to pull functional programming concepts into our imperative and object oriented programming on a design and architecture level. This isn't about using maps and folds in Ruby or Java. We look how immutability reduces the complexity of our code; how referential integrity changes our testing story; and how managing side effects can change our approach to refactoring.

Functional first development also has an impact on our development teams. Learning functional first development is like learning functional programming without learning a new language.
