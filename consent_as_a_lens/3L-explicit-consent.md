# Explicit consent

Explicit consent is a clear and timely offer to share ourselves with someone else.

Explicit consent is bounded. For example, an offer to share in conversation does not extend to argument, an offer to share touch does not extend to sex.

Explicit consent that is very clear and immediately relevant is often called "enthusiastic consent".
