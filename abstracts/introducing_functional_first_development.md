Title:

Introducing functional first development

Description:

Functional programming offers significant benefits to many development teams, including reduced complexity, smaller code bases, less technical debt, easier testing, and more scalability. But adopting a functional programming language is costly - the learning curve for experienced object oriented programmers is steep, it's difficult to find experienced developers, and you're probably looking at a rewrite, not a refactor.

Functional first development is a way to introduce functional programming concepts - and benefits - without changing languages.

This talk starts by building a brief case for functional programming, then introduces a way to pull functional programming concepts into our imperative and object oriented programming on a design and architecture level. This isn't about using maps and folds in Ruby or Java. We look how immutability reduces the complexity of our code; how referential integrity changes our testing story; and how managing side effects can change our approach to refactoring.

He uses Elixir and mob programming to teach functional programming concepts in workshops in the US and Europe, and has a special interest in building teams of functional programmers that productively includes junior developers.

Additional information:

I am writing and publishing blog posts about functional first development while actively working out the details and practices with my team at OC Tanner Company in Salt Lake City, Utah. The first post is at http://version2beta.com/articles/functional_first_development/, and additional posts will come when we've completed the next round of testing on refactoring code.
