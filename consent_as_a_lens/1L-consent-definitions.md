# What is consent?

Etymology: Latin *consentire*, *con-* ‘together’ + *sentire* ‘feel’.

RAINN: "Consent is an agreement between participants to engage in sexual activity."

OED: "Consent is permission for something to happen or agreement to do something."

OED: "Informed consent is permission granted in full knowledge of the possible consequences."

In sociology, **agency** is the capacity of individuals to act independently and to make their own free choices, often limited by structures such as religion, gender, ability, and culture.

My definition: **"Consent is agency exercised by and between two or more people as they relate to each other, the limits of which are informed by cognition, belief, and a cultural narrative."**
