# WWCLondon retrospective

We held an Eleven Ounces of Elixir workshop with the London Chapter of Women Who Code on November 6 and 7, 2015 at Erlang Solutions' London office. Participants ranged in experience from currently learning web programming to professional Java and C# developers, fairly evenly distributed between new developers and experienced developers. A couple of people mentioned having worked briefly with a functional programming language (scheme and haskell) during schooling.

Friday night about 18 people attended including one man, and we spent about 30 minutes socializing over pizza, and 90 minutes installing, and 60 minutes joint live coding (everyone on her laptop) a Words With Friends cheater in the Elixir shell.

Saturday 13 people attended including two men. In the morning, we did joint live coding on a TDD implementation of a pick algorithm, which we then used with our Words With Friends cheat in the shell. After lunch, we discussed how event stores work then broke into two mobs (6 and 7 people each) to code a shopping cart based on an event store.

## How do you feel about your code?

"It's kinda less hacky. You have other people looking at you code, so you become more aware and think things through."

"It's a group effort, everybody is influence the code."

"I don't think it'd be possible to do any of that on my own. Although it was cool to do, I'm not sure on my own I'd be able to do all that much."

"I think it was good to watch your code evolve as well. You start doing it one way and then it goes down another way."

"Everyone had something, an idea at least of how you can work it out. It's almost like you have to have a certain skill level to even know what to google for."

"I can type in the shell, and I can repeat some of the things we did in live coding, and I can get out of the shell again."

"I'd feel comfortable experimenting in the shell and expanding on what I learned today. I learned more today than I could have on my own in the same amount of time."

"I could write a test, at least a simple one."

"We got to the point of being able to count the number of items in the cart, taking into consider items that were removed."

"Individually, I'm disappointed in my code and don't feel like I contributed." "Not true, definitely not true."

"I think it's amazing that even though everyone there knows very little we could still figure something out."

"Make a shopping cart! OMG!" "When we started I thought we weren't going to get anywhere. We got a lot farther than I expected. I think we were all surprised every time something works."

"I think we've gotten better at debugging and looking at the error messages and working it out."

Six people thought they might be able to extend the mob code to show the current state of the cart, at least if they could phone a friend.

"Even though I don't use Elixir in my daily life, I feel like I learned skills I can use in other languages I use."

"I'm not likely to use Elixir but I wanted to learn programming generally and it was good."

"It was definitely a very good experience, and I learned quite a lot. I'm very glad you welcomed me here to be part of the group." "I'm happy to be an honorary lady too. It's a good insight into how functional programming works. It's given me a lot of good concepts I can drag into what I do."

"I did a coding workshop earlier this week, and after this session I think it made everything a lot less daunting. Collaborating this way is brilliant for new programmers."

## How do you feel about your mob?

"The mob was far less stressful than I thought it would be."

"It was far less intimidating than I thought it would be. You had everyone working, everyone looking for something to work so you never really gave up. The environment was motivating."

"I think it was quite exciting as well to be collaborating to something that looked quite complicated, and that everyone contributed part of their knowledge, it was really quite amazing."

"The keyboard just passed around for every member, that was good."

"I think passing the keyboard around separated the tasks as well, so everyone got to work on different aspects of the problem."

"I was amazed that Alicia told me at the end 'I've never programmed before' and I didn't believe her. Everyone's just contributing, and even if you don't know the techical aspects of an idea you can still kinda get there."

"It was quite nice that roles weren't assigned, that we just sat down and started talking and swapped roles constantly. It kept it interesting."

"It was also more productive as well. At one time we weren't working on just one problem. People were searching for other things as well at the same time."

"It felt more productive than on your own. Because you're sort of constantly going, it felt like you got more done."

"We did a whole-mob break and that was fun because we chatted."

"Plus I think you don't get bored quite so easily. Normally when I work alone I get bored quite easily, but in the mob you keep more focused."

"The fact that you have one keyboard and one screen, it helps in the collaboration process."

## How do you feel about yourself?

"Cool."

"I finally learned something new after a few years of only Ruby and Javascript."

"I definitely want to learn more. I think it's more exciting than something like Java for instance."

"I feel confident that I can learn to program. It's not completely far away, out of my reach. It's something I've wanted to learn for a long time."

"I understand functional programming much better now."

"I just wanted to get out of the house." "It's much better than spending Saturday watching TV."

"Free food!" "And really good free food!"

"I'm a newby and I always think 'I don't understand much, I don't know much.' But I kept up with it. And it's more comforting to me, that I want to keep going on this."

"It's great to learn things and do some examples, but seeing how you can use it is really good."

"It'd be really nice to know what level we're at. After doing this weekend, how far along are we to being able to do real programs that do things?"

"I still feel undecided about whether mob programming can work for me."

"I just feel excited."

"I feel very energized. I don't feel half asleep like I do on most Saturdays. I feel like I want to go home and do programming."
