# Implicit consent

Implicit consent is how we signal to other people, but don't explicitly state, that their behavior toward us is agreeable.

* A friend who walks into our home without knocking, and is warmly welcomed, may have implicit consent to walk into our home without knocking.

* If a partner's touch is met with a smile and returned, the partner probably feels as if they have implicit consent to touch.

If we have a pattern of granting explicit consent to a given behavior, that may later become implicit consent, then ongoing consent, and maybe then a relationship expectation.

However, implicit consent is always revocable — the power to grant and withdraw consent lies with us.
