"Men want wives, and if you need a lot of men on your team, you must offer them something that they want. In monogamous groups, unlike polygynous ones, high status males cannot hoard large numbers of women for themselves. The more equal distribution of women in monogamous groups means that more men can acquire wives, and fewer men have to leave the group to search for wives elsewhere. And the larger the group, the more men there are to fight in battles and to pay taxes for the funding of wars. Socially imposed monogamy, therefore, emerged in the West as a reciprocal arrangement in which elite males allowed lower-ranking males to marry, in exchange for their military service and tax contributions."

"The same goes for marriage: it’s not about us. It was never meant to be. It is about the 'other': our spouse, the children and family we create, and the future that we foster. Through these relationships, marriage does offer happiness; but it’s a long-term, long-suffering joy — one that has to surmount many temporary grievances and frustrations. It’s true that marriage isn’t a 'safe' bet for temporal happiness — but marriage is good, and always will be."
