Retrospective, events workshop, OCTanner 2016 Sep 20, 21
 
Things that went well:
* Tools that were used where nice and well made
* Instructions were clear for what needed to be done
* Able to learn from observing
* Focused days (1 for creating events, 1 for innovation)
* Some team leaders were good at selling the event to their team members
* Free lunch and treats
* Prizes
* Mob programming
 
Things that didn’t go well:
* Milestones had a release during the hackathon – limited availability
* Communication to teams of opportunity
* Feels like an interruption, devs being pulled away from work
* Communication about hackathon was too early and then too late
* 9am start time
* Room was stolen (both days!)
* Product not involved
* No one other than those involved in hackathon were at final demo (Product, team leads?)
* Product thinks we are just playing around
 
What should we do differently in the future:
* Make hackathon a priority
* Make product development aware of hackathon so it can be prioritized for devs
* Be aware of hackathon during sprint planning
* Better marketing of hackathon, more awareness (make Cameron the marketer)
* Update email group that receives invite (EDW)
* Hackathon should be a fun event, not formal
* Devs involved should socialize more about event – not just team leaders/managers
* Involve product and get their feedback
* Posters for event
* Invite IT, Product, and company leadership to final demo
* Make participants aware that they don’t have to attend entire event (can jump in where they can)
* Judgment of demos – bragging rights/prizes
* Find track to get the winning feature/app actually into production/Labs
* Winning app should be worked on further by the devs that create the app during the hackathon (don’t ship to Labs)
