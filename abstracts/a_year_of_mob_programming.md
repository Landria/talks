Title:

A year of mob programming

Description:

It started with the creation of a women's internship program. We were planning to make sure all the interns paired full time, but a friend suggested I look at mob programming instead. I was already a little familiar with it, and after a little reading and a little discussion it was easy to see that mob programming had a lot to offer. We decided to try mob programming.

We spent a year talking about, and practicing, mob programming. We did mob programming in teams of senior developers, with people randomly joining because it's new and fun. We did mob programming with interns and juniors, including 50 or so sessions with just two juniors and four interns. And we've created a workshop that uses mob programming to teach functional programming concepts to brand new developers.

After almost every session, we did a retrospective, a treasure trove of successes and failures, hurt egos and amazement.

This talk covers what mob programming is, where it came from, how we do it and why, and the results we documented in our retrospectives. It doesn't answer all possible questions, and in fact we suggests some hypotheses one might choose to try to prove about mob programming.

Bio:

Rob Martin is an engineering manager at OC Tanner Company in Salt Lake City, Utah. He uses Elixir and mob programming to teach functional programming concepts in workshops in the US and Europe, and has a special interest in building teams of functional programmers that productively includes junior developers.

Additional information:

I gave a talk called "Teaching functional programming to n00bs in mobs" at Lambda Days 2016 in Krak√≥w, Poland. I felt like the important part of the talk was teaching functional programming to new developers, but for seven hours after finishing my talk, there were people lined up to discuss mob programming. The interest astounded me, and the feedback was strongly positive.

I have a blog post about our experience that will inform this talk. Right now about 25% of the traffic to my blog is going to this one post. Please feel free to review it as well. http://version2beta.com/articles/mob_programming/
