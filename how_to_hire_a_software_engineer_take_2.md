# How to hire a software engineer / How to get hired as a software engineer

Let's explore a recruiting and interview process that is people-centered, authentic, and collaborative - just like we want our work environments to be. In that same spirit, let's make it totally transparent. Let's explore the process from the perspective of both the interviewer and the interviewee, the hiring manager and the candidate.

This is the recruiting and interviewing process I'm using at OC Tanner Company in Salt Lake City, Utah, one of Fortune Magazine's 100 Best Places to Work. It's how I interview for the teams I manage, and it's the process I train other people to use.

## Recruiting

We'll start with a generalized recruiting process:

1. Always be recruiting.

Job openings come and go more frequently than great developers. Recruit them when you have the chance. That is, get them interested in working with you when the time is right for them and for you.Encourage your teams to do the same too.

2. Work with the community.

You want developers to introduce themselves to you, not the other way around. Speak, teach, coach, mentor, sponsor, host, feed, write, tweet, talk, meet, and get noticed being important to the community.

3. Be authentic and human-friendly.

Make your interview process humane. Set an expectation that the process is collaborative, not competitive. When the candidates you don't hire speak well of your process, you have a powerful new tool for recruiting.

## A specialized recruiting process

We often have specific needs, and we want to tune our recruiting process to meet those needs. Maybe your company is driving up quality, and you want to attract people with experience in software as craft. Perhaps you're carving up a monolithic application and calving microservices. You might want to attract functional programmers, or developers strong in architecture, or programmers in a more obscure language ideal for your application.

For several years I've focused on diversity on engineering teams, especially gender diversity. I have a specialized recruiting process that helps bring more women into consideration for our open positions.

1. We work with the community to help women get into (or back into) programming, by teaching, coaching, and mentoring groups like Girl Develop It, Railsbridge, and PyLadies. We try to get noticed by women while doing this.

2. We've reworked our interview process to be friendly to the individual and to humans in general. We've gotten rid of some interview techniques that have been demonstrated to have a gender bias. We set an expectation that we help each applicant accurately demonstrate their current skill level, not just their interviewing ability.

3. We're starting an internship program, partnering with Girl Develop It Salt Lake City, that will help to bridge the gap between boot camp graduate and marketable, productive developer.

4. We're presenting our practices within our local tech community, especially in groups that support and encourage developers who are women.

Similar tuning can be done to meet other organizational goals. For me, the result has been that about half of the candidates we see are specifically targeting OC Tanner for a job, and some are not even applying at other companies.

## Preliminary advice

Before we launch into the mechanics of our interview process, here is some advice.

### Advice to the hiring manager

Hiring people is a competitive process, and we can't help that. This does not mean that interviewing needs to be competitive too. If you are building teams that collaborate, let your candidates collaborate too. If you are supporting and training your team members to be better developers, do the same with candidates, on a smaller scale.

**Be transparent.**

Share your process with the candidate. Answer their questions directly. Coach them before, during, and after their interview.

**Recruit.**

Don't stop recruiting just because the candidate is interviewing. Hiring is a two way street, and you want the best candidates to say yes when you make your offer.

**Recruit the candidates you don't hire, too.**

Going to send a candidate home without an offer? Keep recruiting. Offer a few minutes of mentoring to the candidates you turn down. What did you like about the candidate? What could he work on to be ready for a job with us? When might she try again?

**Collaborate.**

Structure every interview to see the candidate at their best, just like you're going to structure your team to get the best work from your developers. Let the candidate help you with this.

Sometimes an interview just doesn't work. Maybe the candidate is nervous, or has a language barrier, or doesn't gel well with the interviewer. Stay attuned to how the interviews are going, and be ready to change things to make the process successful. At the end, if you didn't get an accurate representation of the candidate's skills, consider whether you want to do that interview over. For example, a candidate who blanks while pairing on a coding exercise may solve a take-home coding interview elegantly.

**Play Tetris.**

We want candidates that are "tee shaped" - deep skills in at least one area of interest, but broad skills too. What's the right fit for your team? It's almost never just amazing technical skills with the language. You might want to see your team do more pairing, or better testing. Maybe you want someone who is good at sharing and teaching, or helps build cohesion. Look at how each candidate fits the team along multiple dimensions.

### Advice to the candidate

Our collaborative process is only useful if we get your cooperation too.

* We want to know where you're at, in both your skill level and your career, so that you'll be happy with the job we offer you.

* Tell us what you need. We want to see you at your best. If we're not getting that, help us figure out a better way of working with you.

* Tell us what you want. Your coding ability is only part of the equation. We want to see how our goals mesh with your goals.

## How to evaluate an interview

Here's part of our transparency: we want candidates to know how they will be evaluated, and later, how they performed.

### Interviewers and hiring managers

Before you evaluate a candidate's interview, evaluate the interview process. Were you able to get to know the candidate? Do you and the candidate both feel like you got an accurate impression of the candidate's abilities during the interview? If not, is with worthwhile confirming the candidate's skills in another way, like moving to a different space (maybe less casual, like a conference room, or more casual, like a coffee shop?), or with a take home coding exercise, or a corraborating interview with someone else?

I once interrupted an interview taking place in one of our office "living rooms" - small rooms with a couch, a couple of cozy chairs, a big screen TV, and a whiteboard mounted uncomfortably close to the floor. A young woman being interviewed by two engineers (one male and one female) was wearing kneeling on the floor in a skirt and heels trying to solve a coding exercise on the whiteboard.She looked miserable, so we changed just about everything. Instead of the living room, we went to a training room with a desk-height table, office chairs, and bright overhead lighting. Instead of a whiteboard, we had her pair with a female engineer from our team. Instead of being two-on-one, I asked the male engineer to offer the women coffee or tea and then leave the interview. The candidate performed much better under the changed circumstances.

**Fist Five voting**

We evaluate candidates using a modified "fist five" consensus method. We rate the candidate after each interview according to this scale:

* A zero (or a "fist") is a block. Blocking a candidate means that you do not wish to see this candidate continue. Either the candidate is clearly wrong for the job, or the job is completely wrong for the candidate.
* A one or a two ("one or two fingers") calls into question whether we should continue the interview process, but leaves the discussion up to the hiring manager.
* A three indicates that the interview has some reservations, but is willing to support a decision to hire the candidate.
* A four indicates that the interview will support a decision to hire the candidate without reservation.
* A five ("five fingers") indicates that the interview completely supports hiring the candidate and recommends immediate action.

**Percentiles**

Often we will have more than one goal in the hiring process. In these cases we might also ask for a percentile ranking of a candidate in comparison to the current team.

For example, maybe we don't just need a Scala developer, but one with enough language maturity to guide solid developers on a team who just don't have as much language experience. In that case, we might be particularly interested in a candidate who ranks in the 95th percentile on language skill, and is comfortable pairing.

Perhaps we have specific goals around improving software quality. In that case, we might prefer a candidate who ranks high in the interview that covers testing and pairing.

### How a candidate might evaluate an interview

At the end of each interview, your interviewers will already be figuring out how to share their impressions of you with the hiring manager. This is an excellent time to ask what their thoughts are.

* Did the interviewers meet their needs for the interview?
* Do the interviewers feel like they got an accurate impression of your skill level?
* Do you feel like they got an accurate impression? If not, be sure to tell them, or bring it up with the hiring manager.
* Will you get the interviewers' recommendation for the job?

## The interview process, in seven parts

All candidates for a job will get at least one interview, and the candidates who receive offers will get seven interviews total:

1. The phone screen.
2. Lunch.
3. A language skills interview.
4. A design and architecture interview.
5. A craft and quality interview.
6. A community interview.
7. A discussion to create a winning offer.

Let's look at each interview and explore our goals for that interview, along with some ideas on how to win each interview.

### The phone screen

We don't want to waste your time. The phone screen is a go / no-go interview that determines whether it's worthwhile to bring a candidate in for the on-site interview process.

#### What we want to know:

We want to understand why you're looking for a new job, and why you're looking at OC Tanner specifically. Also, we want to know if you can actually code.

#### How to win at this interview:

The best way to win the phone screen is to be an excellent, well rounded developer who knows about the work we do.

**Understand something about our problem domain.**

Computer programming involves two basic sets of skills: understanding the problems, and knowing how to solve them using computers.

Our problem domain is appreciating people. OC Tanner not only wrote the book, we created the entire field. Chances are good you can relate to the work we do. Most of us like to be recognized for the good we do, and shown appreciation in concrete ways.

**Know some computer science.**

There are two sides to a good programmer: discrete skills that help you accomplish specific tasks, and a grasp on theory that lets you generalize your skills to new problems.

A lot of training available to new developers focuses on discrete skills, like creating a web app in Ruby on Rails, or building a user interface in Angular.js. While these are good skills to have, we're going to look for developers who can generalize those skills. Knowing Ruby on Rails is a good thing, but can you do some of the same things in Ruby? What about using another object oriented language like Java? Or a functional language like Scala?

The important thing here is not just to know one way to solve a problem, but to be able to efficiently learn other ways to solve problems. This typically comes from studying computer science theory, or from lots of experience.

**Know at least one programming language well.**

If you only know one programming language, let's hope it's the one we want you to use on the job. A junior dev needs to know at least that much.

It'd be better to know more than one language though, especially if the job calls for a language you don't know. We'll train a good candidate, especially one who can demonstrate he or she knows how to learn languages.

**Know something about platforms.**

Writing a new program from scratch is often a waste of time. We want to get boilerplate stuff done within a framework of open source code that other people have written and proven in the field.

It's always valuable to have discrete skills and experience with common frameworks in the languages you use.

**Know something about databases.**
