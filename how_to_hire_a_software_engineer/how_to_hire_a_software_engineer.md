# How to hire a software engineer / How to get hired as a software engineer

## What this talk is about

The purpose of this talk is to explore a recruiting and interviewing process that is people-centered, authentic, and collaborative - just like we want our work environments to be. In the same spirit, this talk explores the process from the perspectives of both parties - the ones giving the interview, and the ones being interviewed. It's transparent. I'm going to expose the details of the process to all parties.

## Recruiting

### A generalized recruiting process

0. Always be recruiting. Encourage your teams to be recruiting. Job openings come and go more frequently than great developers.
0. Work with the community. Speak, teach, coach, mentor, sponsor, host, feed, write, tweet, talk, meet. Try to get noticed while doing this.
0. Use an interview process to be authentic and human-friendly. Set an expectation that we help each applicant perform at their best. Make sure people who don't get the job speak well of the process.

### A specialized recruiting process

This recruiting process can be tuned to meet specific needs, like building a team that is more quality oriented, or does more functional programming, or does their own devops. For several years I've focused on team diversity, especially gender diversity, so I have a specialized recruiting process.

0. We work with the community to help women get into (or back into) programming. We try to get noticed by women while doing this.
0. We have reworked our interview process to be friendly to the individual and to humans in general. We've set an expectation that we help each applicant perform at their best, in large part by getting rid of some interview techniques demonstrated to have a gender bias.
0. We're starting a new internship program in conjunction with Girl Develop It Salt Lake City that will bridge the gap between “fresh boot camp grad” and “marketable, hirable, productive developer”.
0. We're presenting our new practices within the Utah Valley tech community, and telling everybody that these are “established best practices” because they are.

Similar tuning can be done to meet other organizational goals.

## The interview

### Preliminary advice

#### Advice to hiring managers

Hiring is a competitive process, and we can't help that. That doesn't mean interviewing has to be a competitive process.

* Be transparent. Share your process with the candidate. Answer their questions openly. Coach them before, during, and after.
* Recruit the candidate, even if we don't make an offer. Offer at least a few minutes of mentoring to the candidates you turn down. For example, what could they work on to be ready for a job with us?
* Collaborate with the candidate, just like you'll collaborate with your team members. Structure every interview to see the candidate at their best.
* Identify your needs beyond programming ability. Pairing? Testing? Teaching? Bringing in a new skill set? Recruiting? Team cohesion?

#### Advice to candidates

* Show us where you're at in your skills and career. We want you to be happy in your job.
* Tell us what you need. Collaborate with us. We'll be more comfortable with you if you're more comfortable with us, and making that happen is important to us.
* Tell us what you want. Your coding ability is only part of what we're looking for. Help us explore your goals and see how they mesh with our goals.

### How to evaluate an interview

#### Interviewers and hiring managers

* Were you able to get to know the candidate?
* What strengths and weaknesses came out in the interview? Do the candidate's strengths align with our technical and non-technical needs?
* Do you and the candidate both feel like you got an accurate impression of the candidates abilities in your interview? If not, is it worthwhile confirming the candidate's abilities in another way - i.e. a take-home coding exercise, or a corraborating interview on another day, or finding a better way to evaluate this particular candidate?

#### Fist Five voting

We evaluate candidates using a modified Fist-Five consensus method, specific to the candidate's performance in each interview:

* A zero (or a "fist") is a block. Giving a candidate a fist means you do not wish to see the interview process continue under the current conditions. Either the candidate is completely wrong for the job, or the job is completely wrong for the candidate.
* A one or a two asks whether we should continue the interview process, but leaves the decision up to the hiring manager.
* A three indicates that the interviewer has some reservations, but is willing to support a decision to hire the candidate.
* A four indicates that the interviewer supports the decision to hire the candidate without reservation.
* A five indicates that the interviewer completely supports a decision to hire the candidate and recommends immediate action.

#### Percentile rankings and building a better team

Sometimes it's useful to evaluate a candidate compared to the current team, especially when we have organizational goals.

* If we want to improve technical skill in a language, especially a new language, hiring a developer who is more skilled than the majority of our team (say, 90th percentile) and pairs more than the majority of our team (say, 75th percentile) might be a winning combination. That developer will not only bring language-specific skills, but he or she will also help distribute those skills through the organization.
* If we have specific goals around architectural initiatives, hiring a developer who compares exceptionally well in design skills and has a stronger-than-average bend towards sharing and community is a good plan.

#### Candidates

* Make sure you feel like you accurately portrayed your skill level during the interview. If you don't think you did, be sure to tell the interviewer and/or the hiring manager so we can consider changing things around or supplementing the interview process.
* At the end of each interview, ask the interviewers what they think. Did they meet their needs for the interview? Will you get their recommendation? What do they see as your weaknesses and strengths for the position?

Do this right away at the end of the interview, not later by email or phone. Your interviewer will already be figuring out how to share their impressions with the hiring manager. Plus, it's easier for the interviewer to be fresh and direct with you in conversation than in writing later.

0. A winning offer

### The phone screen

We don’t want to waste anyone’s time. The phone screen is a go / no-go interview that determines whether it's worthwhile to bring a candidate in for a six hour interview process.

What we want to know:

* Why you’re looking, and why you’re looking at OC Tanner.
* Can you solve a simple coding problem verbally?

How to win it:

* Understand something about our problem domain.
* Know some computer science.
* Know at least one programming language.
* Know something about platforms.
* Know something about databases.

#### Understand something about our problem domain.

Computer programming involves two basic sets of skills: understanding the problems, and knowing how to fix the problems with computers.

Our problem domain is recognizing and appreciating other people. OC Tanner not only wrote the book, we created the entire field. Chances are good that you can relate to the work we do. If not, learn, and see how you fit in and why you want to do it.

Do the same thing no matter where you’re applying. Understand the company’s problem domain. Find out how you relate to it. Apply to places where the problems they’re solving are problems you’ve had. Tell your own stories about how you solved them.

#### Know some computer science.

There’s a chicken and egg problem when you’re getting into software development. You have to have both discrete skills (“I can make a web app in Rails!”) and theory (“I can generalize my app, and do it in pure Ruby!”).

Spoiler alert: Most boot camps and almost all one-day and weekend workshops teach discrete skills, and until you can generalize them, discrete skills make you feel like an poser. Really. I may have just called you a poser.

Don’t settle for just Ruby on Rails, or just Angular.js, or just Django. Don’t settle for “This is one way you can do this.” Either learn to build it from scratch, or learn the platform and then figure out how to do it from scratch.

Bonus points! Computer science covers things like recursion and functional programming and algorithms and how programs are structured and interpreted by the computer. As it happens, it’s not too hard to get specific (but generalizable) knowledge in this area that the person interviewing you probably doesn’t even have. And some hot topics right now include functional programming, NoSQL databases, and data science.

* Read “The Little Schemer”, and type in every single line of code in the book. Really. All of them.
* Read “Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs” or take the coursework at cs61a.org or composingprograms.com.
* Take a free online course on data science.

#### Know at least one programming language well.

This one is hard. You need to be good enough in this programming language to meet the job requirements. A junior dev needs to know enough to know how to learn more. A senior dev needs to know enough to teach a junior dev everything she needs to know. AND you’ll probably need to have some understanding of HTML, CSS, and maybe even JavaScript in addition to your programming language.

Sometimes, you’ll need two programming languages, especially when you want to apply for a job programming in a language you don’t know. Having mad skills in two other languages proves you can learn a new language. Knowing the languages well might help you explain why you think your skills are transferable.

#### Know something about platforms.

Writing a new program from scratch is a real waste of time, unless you’re into that kind of thing. Often we want to get all the boilerplate stuff done within a framework of open source code other people wrote, so that we can just focus on the parts of the program that make it different from everything else. In fact, each language has several platforms and frameworks that do all the boilerplate stuff. Some languages have holy wars over which one you should know.

Before you do a phone screen for a programming job, it would be nice to have used at least one framework that is common in your programming language.

#### Know something about databases.

In a phone screen, you might be asked what you know about different databases. It’s also important that you know what you don’t know about databases. For instance, it’s good to say “I used PostgreSQL as the database for my Ruby on Rails project,” or “I don’t understand much about NoSQL.” Most places have a half dozen priests or priestesses responsible for keeping the databases happy, but they will still expect you to know what parts you’re safe poking, and what parts you want to leave alone.

### Lunch

We try to feed every candidate at least once. Some managers prefer to take candidates to fancier local restaurants, along with the team of engineers who will be doing the interviews, but I don’t. We have an exceptional cafeteria / restaurant that is completely relevant to the interview process, and my goal is to include as many of the candidate's prospective coworkers as possible.

If you want to have an expensive meal on the company's dime, treat a winning candidate to a nice dinner while you're discussing her offer.

What we want to know:

* How you relate to our team.

How to win it:

The lunch interview is largely for you to learn about us from a diverse group of people you may be working with. Take advantage of it. Ask questions. Get to know people. Try to be outgoing. It’s a safe space, and we really want you to like us.

### Language specific

We use a variety programming languages on different projects. We want to hire and train developers to be exceptionally competent, often in several languages.

What we want to know:

* What languages do you want to use?
* What’s your level of competency with those languages?

How to win it:

* Show that you’re competent in one or more of the languages you’re most likely to use.
* If you don’t know the language you’re most likely to use, then be excited to learn it. It helps us if you can show you're competent at least one or two similar languages.
* Front end engineers need Javascript, HTML5, and CSS plus frameworks and generally some full stack experience.

#### Show that you’re competent in one or more of the languages you’re most likely to use.

This is a coding interview, and you should expect to have a coding problem to solve.

Some places are going to make you do it on a whiteboard as if you’re a philosophy professor or a trained monkey. We're going to have you pair with one of our programmers, who will guide you through the problem.

We don't hire actors or circus performers. We hire engineers and we want to collaborate. We want the interview to demonstrate how well we do that together.

If you can solve a randomly selected exercise from the first five ProjectEuler.net problems, you’re probably golden for a junior dev. If you can solve any a randomly selected exercise from the first fifteen and describe in detail why your solution is particularly elegant, you’re probably looking good for a senior dev.

#### If you don’t know the language you’re most likely to use, then know at least two similar languages so we know you can learn new languages.

If you don't know the language the job is going to use, that's probably not a big deal. But now you need to solve a problem in one of the languages you know, and explain to the interview why you chose that language over the other one, or however many others you know.

Don’t be surprised if you’re asked to code in their language, even though you said you don’t know it. They may want to pair with you, or see how many crutches you need to get from a blank slate to working code. That's the kind of trick I'd pull, because it shows me how you pair when you don't know what you're doing, how quickly you learn, and how you think outside of the structure of a language you know.

#### For front-end programming, make sure you’re solid on HTML5 and CSS.

You're a front end programmer? Congratulations! We used to act like front end wasn't real engineering, but is now some of the most complicated and difficult programming we do.

Every place interviewing a front end candidate is going to ask about HTML5 and CSS2.1 at least. You’ll need to know it to be even a junior dev, although a few more mistakes will be accepted so long as your understanding of the theory is solid. You'll still need to demonstrate language proficiency in Javascript (or CoffeeScript maybe), understand about shims and polyfills, and know a framework like Angular.js or Ember.js.

### Design and architecture

When we get a new problem to solve, we assign responsibility for figuring out how to solve the problem to the developers who are writing the code.

What we want to know:

* That you can solve the kinds of problems we want to toss your way.

How to win it:

* Know enough about patterns to cover the work you’ll be doing.
* Know enough about databases to have a story and an opinion.
* Pay really close attention to the problem they want you to brainstorm. It’s probably related to the job they want you to do.

#### Know enough about patterns to cover the work you’ll be doing.

Design patterns are a way of solving problems by seeing what kind of problem it is, and then identifying what kind of solution fits well. It comes originally from architecture, like with buildings and stuff. A door is a “part time hole in the wall” sort of pattern; a double wide french door is an implementation detail.

Junior devs should definitely be able to talk about the patterns implemented in work they’ve done. MVC (Model View Controller) and ORM (Object Relational Mapper) are two good places to start.

Senior devs should be able to discuss the patterns they’ve implemented as well as quite a few they haven’t. Concurrency-oriented design patterns and functional programming patterns are hot right now.

#### Know enough about databases to have a story and an opinion.

A junior dev should know what databases they’ve used, if and how they configured it, and how the code connected to and used the database. Bonus points if you can talk about NoSQL databases, or explain why PostgreSQL is a better open source database than MySQL. (Rob Conery has a great talk on this called “Five things you didn’t know about PostgreSQL”.)

A senior dev should know when an ORM is no longer appropriate or performant, and how to remove it; when NoSQL is better than SQL; what the CAP theorem is and how to apply it; what a graph database is and when to use it; and why Hadoop is a much better NoSQL database than MongoDB is. A really good senior dev might also be able to make the opposite argument.

#### Pay really close attention to the problem they want you to brainstorm. It's probably related to the job they want you to do.

For an architecture interview, we don’t have time to build a whole system so we just have some fun imagining we are. What I don’t tell is that I picked out the most important thing that candidate might work on and gave it as their architecture problem. “We have a software package with a very complex configuration. I’d like to talk about how to solve that.” Or “We’ve thought about messages with clients as just email in the past, and we want to integrate new features like SMS and push notification. How might we go about doing that?” Sure I want to see how they approach the problem, but more so I want to see how they relate to the problem. Is he excited? Does she catch on extra quickly? Does he show a particular interest or aptitude?

### Software Craftsmanship

We’re trying to improve our quality practices. Lots of our engineers are doing these things, but we want to bring in more people who consider quality practices indispensable.

What we want to know:

* Do you write tests? What kind of tests?
* Do you pair?
* Can you be responsible for your own releases?

How to win it:

* Write unit tests first.
* Write acceptance tests for new features and regression tests for bugs.
* Practice pairing.
* Manage your own build and deploy processes.

#### Write unit tests first.

We think the best way to write code is to understand what it’s supposed to do, then write a test that proves it can do it, and then write the code that will pass the test. This is a testing pattern, used in practice as test driven development, acceptance test driven development, behavior-driven development, red-green refctoring, property-based testing, and more.

We aspire to code this way, but in practice it doesn’t always happen. We’re still fixing old habits. We want new employees to do a better job at this than we do, so that as a company and department, we keep getting better.

#### Write acceptance tests for new features and regression tests for bugs.

Like many companies, we’re transitioning to make the developer responsible for his or her own quality. We want to prove we did what was needed, that our task is actually done, using a test that will become part of our ongoing suite of tests.

This skill is aspirational for some of our team. Even a junior developer can shine in an interview by better quality habits than we do.

#### Practice pairing

Pair programming does two primary things for a software development team. First, it helps both members learn from the other. Even if one person is a senior developer and the other is a junior developer, both developers improve their skills. Second, it helps our “institutional knowledge” spread around the team more evenly so that nothing is locked up inside of one person’s head.

Coming to an interview with real world experience in pair programming is big. It means we can count on you to make our team better.

#### Manage your own build and deploy processes.

A lot of companies, including OC Tanner, have given programmers much more responsibility over the lifecycle of the code. Not that long ago a developer could be responsible just for the program itself, but now we want the developer to prove her code works, build it, and ship it to the server.

Having experience with operations (how does a server and a network work?) and devops (how can I treat a server like a program?) are two areas where any developer can stand out.

### Community

Anyone working in tech will get help from the community. We want to know when and how you get help, and when and how you contribute back.

(Leadership? Hiring someone you want to work for?)

What we want to know:

* In what ways do you receive help from the community?
* In what ways do you contribute to the community?

How to win it:

* Know the people who have helped you.
* Know the people who wrote the code and the languages you use.
* Give back to the community, in code and support.

#### Know the people who have helped you.

None of us got where we are without other people helping, and many of us rely on other people more or less constantly.

Who do you rely on? Can you name them? Are you able to give them credit for how these individuals have helped you? There’s a big difference between “I Googled my Erlang problem and found a snippet.” and “I Googled my Erlang problem and found Fred Herbert’s website. He’s an Erlang developer at Heroku and he also wrote the book Learn You Some Erlang.”

Who else do you rely on? Do you have a coach? A mentor? A community group or meetup?  A favorite blog or book? An online training course? The IT community is a community of amazing people. Knowing who they are is invaluable.

#### Know the people who wrote the code and the languages you use.

I think Ruby is great. You know why? Because Yukihiro Matsumoto wanted to optimize for programmer happiness, so he focused on creating a language that’s easy to think in. Matz was inspired by Larry Wall, a linguist who created Perl, a programming language for expressiveness. There are even contests where you write poetry in Perl. These aren't just interesting anecdotes; these are some of the reasons why you might want to choose Ruby or Perl for a project.

Who created the languages and platforms and frameworks you like? Why did they create them - what problems were they trying to solve, what kind of beauty did they want to bring into the world? If you don’t know these stories, you’ll never have a full appreciation for the strengths and weaknesses of each language and where it fits in a context of developing our world together.

#### Give back to the community, in code and in support.

What’s your Twitter handle? Where do you blog? Who are you mentoring? Have you presented at meetups? What open source projects have you contributed to? Have you made a contribution to any of the major programming languages? (My friend Kavita Sachdeva had code merged into the Python programming language before she got her first official programming job.) Do you coach for groups or mentor anyone? Have you presented at a meetup? or a regional conference? or a national conference? Which books have you written?

These questions scare a lot of experienced programmers, but if it weren’t for people who do all these things, none of us would be here. The community interview is about demonstrating that you can learn from people, not just websites, and that you have intentionally chosen to give back.

### Designing an offer

If we get to this point, it's because we want to hire you.  We want to write you an offer that will make you happy to come work with us. We want to negotiate honestly and transparently with you, and to make sure that when you have the written offer you won’t be unpleasantly surprised by anything.

What we want to know:

* The details of your ideal offer.

How to win it:

* Ask for what you want, not what you're willing to accept.
* Ask for training and mentoring to be part of your offer.

#### Ask for what you want, not what you're willing to accept.

(also stupid money)

For some people, salary negotiation is much harder than programming. But here a tip to make it easier: It isn’t your responsibility to make sure you’re worth what they pay you. It’s your manager’s responsibility to make sure you’re worth what they pay you.

Ask for what you really want. Maybe it’s a dollar amount, and that’s great. Managers can handle that easy. Or maybe it’s more vacation, flexible hours, and the amount of money you need to live the way you want. Do research and ask people questions about the field, the area, and the company, and then don’t hesitate or waffle. Just ask.

#### Ask for training and mentoring to be part of your offer.

Take the opportunity to increase your lifetime earning, not just your next salary.

Chances are good that you're not ready for your last job in software. You still need more coding skills, or management experience, or leadership training. Or maybe what you need is someone to help you figure out what you need.

Thinking short term, a lot of companies offer training. Your best time to get a bigger slice of that is in your offer. What will help you do this job better? Propose it.

Thinking long term, tell your hiring manager where you want to end up in your career. Senior developer? Management? VP-Engineer or CTO? Talk with the hiring manager about ways the company supports employees who want to advance.
