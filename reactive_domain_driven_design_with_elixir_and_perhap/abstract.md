# Reactive Domain Driven Design (rDDD) with Elixir and Perhap

## Short abstract (512 characters)

Reactive systems are responsive, resilient, elastic, and event driven. Domain driven design models architecture after the way our businesses speak, think, and organize the problems they solve. Combined, rDDD meets the needs of modern applications.

Our goal is to explore ways that rDDD and Perhap:

* Match our product development needs
* Provide a platform, not just a framework
* Help juniors deliver more value more often
* Produce simple, demonstrably correct code

## Abstract

Reactive systems are responsive, resilient, elastic, and event driven. Domain driven design models software architecture after the way humans - our business partners - organize, speak, and think about the problems they solve. Not surprisingly, these two approaches to software design work well together and produce architectures that meet our expectations exceptionally well.

This talk approaches domain modeling from a functional perspective using Elixir and a nascent open source library called Perhap, but the techniques are equally applicable in any functional language and quite a few languages that support multiple paradigms. It's a different way of looking at our code, one that integrates neatly with the Elm architecture, or the React + Redux approach. In our application at Wrench.ai, we also use it for modeling real world behaviors to use as inputs for ML and deep learning.

Our goals for this presentation are to explore ways that Reactive Domain Driven Design (rDDD) and Perhap:

* Better match the needs of modern applications
* Reinforce a platform approach to product development
* Bring developers into a functional paradigm
* Help juniors deliver more value more often
* Produce simple, demonstrably correct code
