# One Penis Policy

From Psychology Today (https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-polyamorists-next-door/201601/the-one-penis-policy):

"In theory, polyamory is a form of consensual non-monogamy (CNM) that allows people of any gender to have partners of any gender. In practice, it can be incredibly difficult for some heterosexual men to allow the women in their polycule – “their” women – to partner with other men. This phenomenon happens frequently enough that it has become cliché in mainstream poly communities and earned the title of the One Penis Policy (OPP)."
