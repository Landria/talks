# Retrospective / z mocą wsteczną

Kraków, Poland 21 Feb 2016

## Overview

We did an Ounce of Elixir workshop in Kraków, Poland with 9 mobbers in two mobs over 7 hours. One mob had 5 mobbers, and one had 4. The projects was an event-sourced shopping cart application.

## How do you feel about your code?

"It works!" "It's kinda messy but it works!"

"It should work but it doesn't :-("

"For a starter, I think the code is nice."

"I'm pretty intrigues about our code and I'd like to make it work."

"I would make it different, but what we've got here, it's better than I thought it would be. The dieas here work perfect and I feel like I made learned something because of the mob programming."

"First of all Im happy because of the way we did it. The result was very satisfying."

"I'm proud of my code. And it's not very high quality."

"I'm glad for learning new stuff."

"We wrote only 33 lines of code. (Without tests.) It's very efficient. We wrote more but a lot of it we deleted when we decided it wasn't what we wanted to do."

"And we didn't have time to refactor it. Maybe we would have seen it could have been written considerably smaller."

"We wrote two or three functions that didn't do much. They didn't do anything basically."

## How do you feel about your team?

"We had some language problem. If we spoke the same language, it would be easy. Instead we just spoke in English. It wasn't comfortable because we think in another language and try to translate our thoughts to English and explain something we want to say."

"It was a bit hard at the beginning, but it was very nice experience to genuinely exchange our ideas concerning the code."

"Great teamwork."

"We had complementary skills. We had people who knew Github, when others didn't, you know?"

"All of us participated equally. Or not?"

"Nothing to add. I agree it was a great experience. We get what we can from the team, but sometimes we dig too much. It was hard to do test driven development for us. We want to complicated things that were simple. I like it thought because then we learned from our mistakes."

"It was easier to solve the problems, because all of us had different ideas, and then we could compare them and pick the best one."

"I think that at the beginning, we didn't even know how to start with the program, and we didn't know how to use all the ideas from Igor. We found a solution with small steps. Igor was helpful in that."

"I guess it mattered a lot. When we tried to listen, there were plenty of ideas, but it was the English that was best for expressing for them. If we could have all talked one language, it would have helped a lot and sped the process."

"I feel like I'm the stupid one on our team because I didn't understand what other people said, but when they write some code, I understand. I always asked for help with something."

"I think we had the same problem. When someone had an idea, we had trouble understanding it. When someone put it on the screen, then we understood it. When someone showed the code, it was much easier to understand what they were talking about."

"Sometimes we just try an idea, and if it doesn't work at least we tried it."

## How do you feel about yourself?

"Tired."

"I learned a lot, and I really appreciate it."

"I like the second day when we worked in team. It was very productive. The first day was just repetition of what you did, without complete understanding what we're doing."

"I started to enjoy working in a group."

"Programming in a group was completely different from what I've done. I found it quite pleasant."

"Fun." - Kat

"Excited. It was a lot of fun."

"I learned a lot about team work."

"I want to do something else using Elixir."

"I feel like I was a fifth wheel. It was really challenging to sit there and know what to do but sit silent and try to hint, but kind of failing. It wasn't really fun, I would say. When I joined in, everybody gets silent so I better stay away."
