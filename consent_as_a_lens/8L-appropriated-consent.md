# Appropriated consent

Appropriated consent is a consent violation.

* If we insist we are entitled to something from another person on the basis of cultural norms, societal labels, or religious teaching, regardless of whether consent is given, we are appropriating another person's natural consent.

* If we accept consent knowing that the other person is not adequately informed to grant consent, we are appropriating consent.

* If we accept consent knowing another person is not capable of granting consent, for instance because they are too young, in a subservient position, or intoxicated, we are appropriating consent.

The typical justification for appropriated consent is entitlement.
