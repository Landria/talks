# Delegated consent

Delegated consent is when we allow cultural expectations to replace our explicit or implicit consent.

* We might delegate natural consent to societal and cultural structures by assuming gender roles without independent consideration.

* We might delegate natural consent to the church if we allow religious teaching to dictate how we relate to others.

* We might delegate natural consent to a partner by allowing labels like “girlfriend” or “fiancée” or “wife” to define what is and is not permissible in our relationships.

Delegated consent is a limit to our natural consent.
