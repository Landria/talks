# Consent and Kink

## Abstract

In this talk, we explore questions around kink and consent, especially when considering dom/sub and master/slave relationships.

* What is consent, outside of kink? What is it outside of sex?
* How can we apply consent to BDSM play?
* Where does consent fit with 24/7 kink relationships, such as master/slave?

We'll start with this definition: "Consent is agency exercised by and between two or more people as they relate to each other, the limits of which are informed by cognition, belief, and a cultural narrative." From there, we can look at different types of consent, including natural, explicit, implicit, ongoing, delegated, shared, and appropriated consent. Finally we'll discuss how consent is, or can be, applied to BDSM, especially 24/7 relationships with significant power differentials.



Being kinky often means taking - or giving up - control. Our play could leave us
in a position where our abililty to grant or revoke consent is, well, muzzled.
Safewords might be lost when a top's mind is in top space.
