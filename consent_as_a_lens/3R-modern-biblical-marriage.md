# Modern biblical marriage

From the Family Research Center (http://www.frc.org/brochure/the-bibles-teaching-on-marriage-and-family):

* "[M]arriage and the family are institutions under siege today, and only a return to the biblical foundation of these God-given institutions will reverse the decline of marriage and the family in our culture today."



* "[T]he Bible makes clear that, at the root, marriage and the family are not human conventions based merely on a temporary consensus and time-honored tradition. Instead, Scripture teaches that family was God's idea and that marriage is a divine, not merely human, institution."



* "[A] covenant is a contract between two parties that is established before God as a witness, a contract whose permanence is ultimately safeguarded by none other than God himself. In this sense, marriage is a covenant: it is entered into by the husband and the wife before God as a witness."



* "God will never sanction a marital bond between two members of the same sex."



* "Scripture is clear that wives are to submit to their husbands and to serve as their 'suitable helpers,' while husbands are to bear the ultimate responsibility for the marriage before God."



* "[P]remarital sex is also illegitimate, since it violates the exclusive claims of one's future spouse."



* "[N]ot only did polygamous marriage fall short of God's original design, it regularly resulted in disruptive favoritism, jealousy between competing wives, and decline into idolatry."



* "Paul even called celibacy a 'gift from God'. He further suggested that married people's interests were divided while the unmarried could devote themselves wholly to the Lord. What is more, Jesus taught that in the eternal state, there will be no more marriage, but all will be 'like angels in heaven'.



From http://frc.org/PolygamyAndReligiousLiberty:

* "Monogamous marriages ensure that both fathers and mothers are certain that a baby born to them is theirs."



* "Monogamous marriages ensure that husband and wife will together care for, nurture, and educate their children until they mature."



* "Monogamous marriages deter both spouses from destructive sexual behavior outside the home."



* "A co-wife, once pushed aside by another, will be sorely tempted to test her neighbor's or servant's bed, unless threatened with grave retribution."
