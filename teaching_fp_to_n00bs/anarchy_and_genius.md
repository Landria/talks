# Anarchy and genius in a development team

Anarchy
* Self-governed
* Non-coercive
* Stateless
* Non-hierarchical
* Anti-authoritarian mutualism
* Participatory

Software engineering trends toward anarchy
* Dress code
* Flexible, well apportioned workspace
* Life balance at work (games, drinks, entertainment, naps, etc.)
* Flextime
* Unlimited PTO
* Unlimited maternity / paternity leave (!)
* Engineering-driven organizations
* Flat organizational charts
* Choice of assignments and teams

10x developers
* Make better decisions an order of magnitude more often
* Comparison:
  * Average dev makes ten average decisions each of which return an average value = 100% (baseline)
  * Poor dev makes ten sub-average decisions, each of which drive value down 25%, compounded = 5.6% of baseline
  * 10x dev makes ten decisions each of which drives value up by 25%, compounded = 931% of baseline
* How 10x devs drive value up
  * Simple
    * We write less code and we do less work.
    * We can reason about our code. You can reason about our code too.
    * We used the right abstractions (both programming language *and* design patterns).
    * Our code is unencumbered by unneeded dependencies.
    * Our code scales seamlessly in production.
  * Correct
    * Our code is free from defects.
    * Our code correctly does only what's specified. We don't ship technical debt.
    * We can extend our code without starting from scratch.
    * We can demonstrate (with unit tests) and sometimes even prove our code.
    * Our code is secure.

Some pitfalls - management priorities
* It's not 10x if it doesn't control maintenance cost
* The Agile / Technical Debt trap
