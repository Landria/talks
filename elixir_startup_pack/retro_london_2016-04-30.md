## How do you feel about your code?

"Yay!" "Great"

"We had some cool insight into data structures. Like prepending singly-linked lists." 

"It's a mess but we had a go at it." 

"I think our code was really clean. We had good solid tests and we wrote the minimum we needed to make them pass. It worked."

"It's working. We were able to add, remove, and get contents of the cart, reduced for every request."

"We had tests for the service, but not the API."

"Slightly dirty."

"Naming conventions were not consistent. Some are CamelCase, some were underscore."

"We returned valid JSON. It was empty, but still. You could hit 'add', but it would return an empty cart. That was still high-five-worthy!"

## How do you feel about your mob/team?

"Compared to last time I mobbed, I thought this was better. Five people felt like the right number of people."

"I felt like the others were more knowledgeable. I kinda felt not really equipped to give effective help. I did try to help, but I felt like it wasn't helpful."

"We said at the beginning we should think out loud. It's hard to think out loud and listen at the same time. You have all these people thinking about a solution. At some point it has to come down to one solution."

"There was a lot of details that we discussed. That was really helpful. If I'd been on my own I would have lost some of those details." "I agree."

"I like that we spent a good half hour game planning the data structures and what we wanted to accomplish before we wrote one line of code. I thought that was helpful."

"I thought we had something interesting. We had people from very different backgrounds. We tried to set the pace so that it was right for everyone. It was really good." "I felt like I was slowing you down, but it was enjoable and I learned a lot. I'm glad I came along."

"I think I would have accomplished more on my own, definitely. I would have started in a different mode. I wouldn't explore tangents. The way we did it, we learned more and we accomplished less."

"If you want to introduce new technology to your team or your company, this gives you a much better understanding."

"It's important to have fun. Starting a new technology is always difficult. Starting with a mob allows some easiness into it."

## How do you feel about yourself?

"The functional way of looking at things was something I had to think hard about. We had to think about how to model the application. We didn't have the object, we didn't have the state. We had to change the way we think to solve the problem different from traditional methodologies."

"What I really liked was that it wasn't a pure Phoenix workshop. By separating this into an umbrella project, we couldn't copy and paste. We had to understand the code. Keep that."

"This isn't a goal oriented exercise. It's not about producing the code. It's about learning the stuff."

"I think the tutorial was really important."

"It's mainly the code examples. If I have a repo and I can see it, I can make something more complex. For us it was a little bit of talking about how to do it, because we didn't have example code."

"All the discussion, I really enjoyed the mob. If I was alone, it'd be boring. I might achieve more, but in the mob the discussion and the details was really good."

"But not having an example meant we had to look it up in the right places."

"When you came into the room from time to time, but you didn't help. I'm not sure if that is good or not."

"It might be helpful to have time planning in advance. If you're not reaching the milestones, maybe downscale it a little bit."

"We took our own pace. We cared less about finishing than about doing it right. For me personally, this is the only correct attitude. We discussed things in detail until everyone understood it. If you can't explain it, you probably don't understand it."

"We didn't know each other before. To touch base, to make sure we were on the same page about our coding, we started with discussion. For me personally that worked really well."

"I would have felt pressure if there'd been time boxes."

"I felt like I could keep up with the pace of what the group was doing. If I couldn't follow along with the mob, four hours would have been far too long. That's what happened the first time I mobbed."

"Might be effective to go through a scenario how to handle when you fall behind in the mob."

"I enjoyed it. I can't say I followed everything 100%, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. I felt like a weight on the group sometimes because of my lack of knowledge but I enjoyed it."

"It'd be cool to short-circuit some frustration and have some cheat sheets about the language. Sometimes there are things where you need knowledge, not insight, and having that handy is helpful."
