# Eleven ounces of Elixir

## We're in this together

There's more than one way to write a programming language. Two of the most popular right now are Object Oriented Programming and Functional Programming.

In industry, we teach Object Oriented Programming to new developers, and let senior developers teach themselves Functional Programming, if and when they decide it's important to their work.

In academia, we teach Object Oriented Programming to the people who want to be developers, and Functional Programming to the people who want to be computer scientists regardless of whether they plan to stay in academia.

There's a problem with Object Oriented Programming. It doesn't play nicely at "internet scale". It's great when you have a few dozen or even a few thousand users for your program, but most successful object oriented programs need to be rewritten when a lot of people want to use your program. Often it's rewritten as an object oriented program still, but even that can be a lot of work.

Lots of successful startups have experienced this. They know they've really made it because they have so many users their systems are crashing.

I want us to help fix this. I want us to figure out strategies for "surviving success". That's what we're doing this weekend.

Functional programming is one of the ways to survive success, because a lot of functional programming languages are designed to work better when you need to take care of a lot of users. Many of the really successful startups - Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and more - rewrote their object oriented programs in functional programming languages in order to survive their success.

So why don't we start with functional programming so we don't have to rewrite? There are a few reasons.

* The really good tools and languages for testing product ideas are (mostly) Object Oriented.
* Most people who make startups are entrepreneurs, not programmers. Sure, they may learn programming, and it's easy to learn enough Object Oriented Programming to test out your idea in the market.
* It's easy to get programmers who can do object oriented programming, and hard to get programmers who can do functional programming. Plus, they're much more experienced (because they did object oriented programming for a long time first) so they cost a lot.

If we want to change this, here are some things we can work on:

* We can help identify, develop, and promote languages and tools that are both functional and good for testing our product ideas.
* We can help people who aren't programmers learn to use those languages and tools.
* We can help people who want to be programmers start their careers with a functional programming language.

There's a lot of "we" in that. We're programmers, and wannabe programmers. We're entrepreneurs. We're teachers and coaches and mentors. And this weekend, we're going to learn things together.

## How it works

This workshop is called "Eleven Ounces of Elixir" because we're going to spend about eleven hours together learning little bits about a functional programming language called Elixir. At the end of the program, we should all know enough Elixir to keep learning more. That's our measure of success - that we want to learn more, and that we have enough experience with programming in Elixir that we can satisfy our desire to learn more both on our own and with other people.

We're going to start with an introduction to programming in Elixir. We'll talk a little about functional programming, but that's not really our emphasis. Mostly, we're just learning Elixir.

After we get through some basics up on the big screen, we'll get Elixir set up on your computer and start doing some simple programming. I encourage people to work in pairs, and we'll have some simple exercises we can try.

Tomorrow, we're going to do something a little bit different. It's called Mob Programming.

Mob programming was started by a guy named Woody Zuill in San Diego. He knew that putting programmers together in pairs worked better than having them work alone, so he wondered what would happen if he put all his programmers together. His whole team, working on the same problem on the same screen and the same keyboard, all at the same time.

What he found, and what other people have found too, is that when you put your whole team together in a mob, cool stuff happens.

* The team learns from each other. Constantly.
* The code is better, because everyone who has anything to contribute is there contributing.
* Everyone knows how things work.
* Only one person is on the keyboard, and people take turns. We learn different things when we run the keyboard.
* The team learns to talk about the work really well. Everyone knows the problem domain, and everyone knows the solution.
* The team learns to talk to each other much, much better. People learn to communicate empathetically with each other. People learn to see and listen to each other.

Mob programming makes us better programmers and better people.

So tomorrow, we're going to mob program. Each mob will have about 8 people, a big screen, a computer, and a keyboard. Each mob will choose from two different problems to solve. If you solve one, solving the other one will be easy for you, so maybe you'll choose to solve them both.

While most people participating in this workshop are new developers, we also have some more experienced developers here. For the most part, they don't know Elixir, but they do know how to program, and they know how people learn to program. Their primary roles are to help the mob move forward together.

So let's start learning some Elixir!
