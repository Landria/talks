Title:

Why be functional?

Description:

Functional programming languages are among the oldest in industry (Lisp, 1958) and newest (Elixir, 2012). Some of the most interesting work a developer can do is being done in functional programming languages at companies like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Yammer, Netflix, Amazon, Groupon, SoundCloud, Quora, and Airbnb. Financial companies from Jane Street and Goldman Sachs to Bet365 use functional programming languages for key infrastructure. Functional programming carries the majority of our phone traffic, on equipment built by Ericsson, Motorola, and T-Mobile. Databases like CouchDB and Riak are built on functional programming languages. Message brokers like RabbitMQ and Kafka process a million or more messages a second per server using functional programming.

What can we learn from these companies and applications? It's easier to write software that is simple, scalable, and demonstrably correct with a functional programming approach, especially when compared to object oriented programming.

This talk explores the benefits from using functional programming; surveys the languages available; explains the differences between functional and object oriented programming; and introduces the key concepts a developer needs to know in order to make a shift to a functional approach to programming.

Bio:

Rob Martin is an engineering manager at OC Tanner Company in Salt Lake City, Utah. He uses Elixir and mob programming to teach functional programming concepts in workshops in the US and Europe, and has a special interest in building teams of functional programmers that productively includes junior developers.

Additional information:

This talk is my argument for functional programming, my own version of John Hughes' "Why functional programming matters". I've presented it in internal training sessions and as part of conference talks on Erlang, on Elixir, and on teaching functional programming to new developers. This will be my first full conference talk on this subject, and I'm confident it will generate interest.
